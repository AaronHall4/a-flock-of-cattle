Grew up as the family of a servant woman, therefore she was destined to become a hand maiden. Didn't suit the lifestyle; not good at any of that fiddly or piddly crap that's expected.
She did however learn to move quietly, quickly and be precise - these are the skills a servant needs.
Still, the master was a mean bugger - didn't like lip, even if it was an apology for something unpreventable.
That didn't sit well. The guys could take a beating, but the hand maidens were frail by comparison.
One evening, she decided to stand up for the weaker girls - took the geezer's belt mid-stroke and showed him a thing or two about how it can be used.
Fled the house. No need staying when there's no master, no?
Ended up in a bigger city. No money. Good eyes though, still light on her feet.
Lots of women need protecting here, seeing as they work the oldest, most dangerous female profession, if you catch my meaning.
Started working as a Drake for some of the ladies that stay out too late, keeping things running smoothly.
When the business dried up due to a liche lord, she turned what skills she learned in the gutters into a profession as a sellsword.
