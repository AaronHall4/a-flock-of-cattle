Studying up in his tower just outside the small town where he grew up in. One day he is studying a transformation spell that would allow him to change into anyone that he so chooses at will. Through a mistake of his own he miscasts the spell so that, even though he is given the ability to transform at will, it also transformed the town below into a hoard of horribly disfigured beasts, and removed his ability to speak. The king sent his troops to deal with the beasts, killing everyone Tom ever cared about. For his misdeeds, Tom was cast out of the kingdom and forced into a life as a nomad. Soon he met up with his current adventuring group to kill an adolescent dragon.
