was once a lead chef in a castle of elves. She would often times make jokes and talk with the elven princess, and they became best friends. The chef would make her special pies or pastries to cheer up the princess on bad days.
When the time came, it was arranged for the princess to be wed and moved to her new husband's castle. She wished for one thing and one thing only: that the chef be able to join her in the new castle. The parents agreed, so they packed their things into a carriage and headed to the new castle.
On the way there, bandits ambushed the caravan and in a panic, the chef let out a huge surge of electrical blue energy, instantly killing everyone in a twenty foot radius. Her princess lay lifeless in her seat in the carriage, and there the chef wept, wondering how and why this had happened. She heard footsteps approaching, and not sure how to wield the powers she had within her, the chef removed the cloak from the princess' body, covered herself with it, and skittered into the forest to hide.
In the forest, the halfling tried to recreate the powers, and eventually learned that she is what people call a "wild magic sorcerer". With this knowledge and a couple of learned cantrips, the ex-chef headed out to find adventure, a new life that she was willing to live in order to right the wrong she had done by killing her princess.
