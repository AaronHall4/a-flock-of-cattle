The two brothers gambled together frequently and were usually getting into trouble. After a long night of drinking and playing cards, the Sorcerer lost all of their money to a hustler in the back room of a dirty old tavern. In a fit of rage, the Sorcerer slams his fists down on the the table, evoking Burning Hands, blasting the room with fire, his first spell, revealing to him his powers for the first time. The kegs of hard liquor in the back room exploded from the heat, bringing the building down on top of it's patrons.
He was the only one to survive the blaze. Knowing he would be wanted for mass murder, he left immediately, running as fast as he could to the wild, partially burned from his own wrongdoing. The death of his brother lies to his fault. He vowed that forevermore he would only use his newly discovered powers for only good and prove to himself that he is not evil. He would master his magical art and learn to control his rage, living in his brother's name as tribute. He vows to destroy evil wherever it lies, even though he believes that evil lies within himself.
