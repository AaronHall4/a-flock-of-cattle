He was raised alone by his mother, who was a blacksmith for the clan.
His name comes from the night he was conceived, under a moon that the clan shamans said was filled with ominous portent. Bad Moon never knew his father, just that he was a human, temporarily sheltering in the Stoneheart lands on the way to some other destination. Unbeknownst to Bad Moon, his father was a necromancer who was seeking out an ancient tomb past the Stoneheart lands.
In the Stoneheart clan, a man's wealth is measured by the amount of pigs he owns and the amount of wives he has. First you get the pigs, then the wives are drawn to you, due to your wealth and status. Bad Moon struck out on his own as soon as he was able, to seek his fortune and build the biggest pig farm the Stonehearts had ever seen.
Due to his youth and his clan's focus on conspicuous wealth, Bad Moon wears a lot of gold jewelry, such as rings, armbands and armor decorations. One of his tusks is capped over in gold. He wears a thick leather kidney belt with a boar head medallion on the front.
Bad Moon is boisterous, quick to laugh and quick to fight. He detests those that would use their martial power for oppressing the weak, rather than defending. And he despises all weavers of the dark arts.
