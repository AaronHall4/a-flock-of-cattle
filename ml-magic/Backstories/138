Bonesnap was kept and trained at birth to be a fighter, whereas Bonestab and Bonecrunch were given away, sold as slaves. Bonecrunch and myself were then brought up as slaves for labor, until we were old enough to fight as pitfighters. Unfortunately, it was only a matter of time, however, that Bonestab was to fight his own brother, Bonecrunch, to the death. He didn't want to, but it was his only choice and he had to fight to survive. Bonestab ended up killing his own brother, but in his anger, he managed to escape his slavers, bringing his brothers body with him for a proper burial. Once free, he kept the front piece of Bonecrunch's skull, and wears it as a mask to remind him of his past (also to cover up his horribly scarred and disfigured face). He wandered the wilderness for some time, abandoning his old life of anger and meaningless brutality. Eventually, he came upon a monk monastery, who finally agreed to take him in, training him in the Way of the Sun Soul, as long as he agreed to be an acolyte of their tradition.
With his newfound abilities, and extended training, he set off to explore the land he never got to see. Somewhere along the line (this is where the story is a little undeveloped) he reunited with his brother Bonesnap, who now travels by his side. Together they roam the forgotten realms, helping cities and villages any way they can.
