Bandor Rex was born for glory. He was raised on the many tales and deeds of his ancient blood line told to him by his sage like grandfather. Armed with a powerful family heirloom blade his grandfather passed down, Bandor has set out into the world to fight evil with the confidence of a champion. With the ancient blood of heroes pumping through his veins, there is no way he can fail. Or so he believes.
In reality, Bandor is carrying an old longsword given to him by his senile old Grandfather. There is no heroes blood in him. His family have a long history of tending gardens.
The running joke is he believes his family name is special, but no one has ever heard of them. Everywhere he goes his history of battles and location specific information is wrong.
Eventually though, he just might make his family name recognizable and become a warrior in his own right.
