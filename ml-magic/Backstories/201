Bartholomew Krantzton was sick of dirt. He'd been farming, digging, planting, or transporting dirt in one way or another since his youth, and he wasn't going to do it any more.
He was sick and tired of the knights and nobles that looked down on him from their castles. He had dug their moats and raised their earthen embankments. He deserved to sit inside their protection, not to toil endlessly in the hot fields pulling crop after crop out of the ground so those leeches could get wealthy off his sweat.
"The nobles provide for our protection!" His mother would explain, but protection from what? They had already robbed him blind.
30 years on this earth and only 30 gold pieces to his name, Barty accepted what he knew all along: wealth is not earned, it is taken. And by Hextor he was ready to take it!
