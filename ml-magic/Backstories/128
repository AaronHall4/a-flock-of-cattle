Marud d'chauncy was a con artist who had drifted around town from town for most of his life, being a general n'er do well, when in a game of "chance" he won a wizard's spare spell-book, he cracked it open and realized he actually had bit of a knack for this magic stuff, but he knew no-one would take him seriously, so he crafted up the persona of Seer Charles Di'finlay of the western isles, seer to kings and queens alike. he used this persona to live a life in the upper class, and used his divination talents to gain an edge while telling the lords and ladies only the parts they wanted to hear about their future. however nothing could last forever, and when a baroness saw her way into his pants, and was caught, he quickly exited stage left. he now has a bounty on him and is in general hiding with adventuring parties to earn enough gold to clear his name, as well get some extra for himself.
