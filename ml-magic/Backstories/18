Erdan was born to a wealthy family in the forests of Evermeet.  His parents were art dealers, and his older sister, Lia, was an aspiring magician.  Because of his background, he had practically everything he needed at home: an education, places to play, and anything else the servants could provide.  Thus, he never really had a need or desire for friends, besides his family and servants at home.
One day, while practicing her magic, Lia suffered a terrible accident which gravely injured her.  Seeing his beloved sister hurt like this, Erdan was distraught and desperate to find someone who could heal her.  Most doctors were unfamiliar with the particular injuries she sustained, so there was nothing they could do to help.  On the verge of losing hope, Erdan happened to come across Aelar Naïlo, a traveling cleric of Angharradh, the Elven goddess of wisdom and protection.  He brought Aelar before his ailing sister, asking if there was anything he could do for her.  Fortunately, Aelar knew the advanced healing techniques needed to treat Lia, so he successfully healed her.  Amazed and overjoyed by the kindness and ability of the cleric, Erdan decided he would like to become Aelar’s disciple, in order to learn how to heal others.
Erdan trained with Aelar for the next 50 years.  He mastered the basics of healing quickly, and before long he was familiar with some of the more advanced techniques.  He became a devout follower of Angharradh and began a life of wandering and helping those in need.  However, given his isolated upbringing and even more isolated training, Erdan never really learned how to interact with people well.  He always meant well and truly desired to help others, but he often got into nearly violent disagreements with people and frequently came across as a jerk.  He’s been trying to get better at talking to people, but he still has a long way to go.
