Grim was born a commoner, raised by a single mother, and lived a life of poverty. Growing up, Grim always excelled at everything he put his mind to. He was esceptionally good at stringed instruments, and soon was the sole breadwinner of his household purely by the pluck of a banjo or the strum of a lute. He found he made the most money playing songs in bars and taverns, and that typically the more shady the establishment, the bigger the payout. One night, while playing in a particularly rotten bar known for being the hideout of a well-established thieve's guild, he was approached by what he later found to be a backstabbing second in command. "Can you keep a secret little boy?", the man asked. "Sure!... For a price" replied Grim, with a sly wink and an outstreched hand. This was the begining of a long and fruitfull relationship. Grim would eavesdrop on the patrons of the bar and gather information, reporting directly to the man in exchange for gold. After a particularly juicy bit of information, the thieves guild leader was assassinated, and its new backstabbing leader took the throne. Grim was allowed full membership, and found that his way with words and vast variety of skills was particularly useful. He helped perform numerous hiests, robberies, assassinations and blackmailings, but one day got on the wrong side of the wrong people. He found out that his mother was killed, murdered to leave a message. He cut ties with the guild and set off on his own, not knowing where he was headed or what he wanted to do, but knew he had to go. Perhaps searching for a wish spell, to bring back his mother, or maybe just the next big heist, Grim would figure all that out on the road.
