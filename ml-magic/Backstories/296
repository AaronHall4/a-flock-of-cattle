Fell in love with a disguised archfey and willingly gave her his soul (she gave him powers because she figured it would be amusing). Since he doesn't quite understand how pacts work, he sees himself as a cleric of a love goddess and all his attacks are love-themed (pink hearts for Eldritch Blast, walks into a giant red rose that closes then un-grows into a seed for D-Door, magical girl transformation for disguise self, etc)
