Parents are gaudy, popular politicians whose kids all went to a prestigious school and do a lot of philanthropy work. Their hearts are in the right places but they live decadent lives and people from across the kingdom revel in gossip about their lives, have fan clubs etc.
My character is the worst at magic out of the family, and after one too many public scandal was used as the scapegoat. He's lived such a sheltered life that he doesn't understand he's been screwed, and basically doesn't know how tough the world is. He's naive and friendly, and though he isn't cruel he's lived in such a bubble he's unintentionally very egotistical.
