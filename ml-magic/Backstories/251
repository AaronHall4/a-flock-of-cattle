serves the God of interpersonal relationships. I was raised by an antisocial wizard (who murdered my bandit lord mother due to having been sentenced to community service by a magical council). He grouchily took me in and taught me (almost) everything he knew, but I was always more physically inclined. Eventually he just vanished one day, and I went off to try to find him. I became a cleric after I read about a god I'd never heard of in his personal books, which I had previously been forbidden from reading. I chose to follow this god in my quest to find my father (cause despite my understanding of the circumstances of my birth, I consider him my real father). Little did I know, his disappearance was due to a successful experiment meant to elevate him to godhood, the god in the books was a complete fabrication meant to mislead rival wizards who might steal his books after his death, and he's the one who is granting me miracles.
