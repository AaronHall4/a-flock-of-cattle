Juniper Morningleaf is an 18 year old lightfoot halfling from Dim's Hollow, a forested hamlet in a valley to the east of Halfrock. Dim's Hollow maintains a comfortable economy cultivating moonglow, a phosphorescent spore native to the region that is prized by nearby nobles for its decorative appeal. When Baron Davius of Halfrock launched a program to evict the residents of Dim's Hollow and harvest moonglow more aggressively, Juniper lead a small band of halflings on raids of trickery against the Baron's men, eventually convincing them that the forest was cursed and driving them out. The halflings of the Hollow were thrilled to be able to go back to their peaceful lives, but after his success Juniper began to feel that he was called to something more. He set off into the world carrying only his trusty staff and a knife given to him by his father and accompanied by Thunder, his riding dog and oldest friend. As he left, he swore to use whatever skills he had to combat the oppression of the common people wherever he found it.
After a year on the road, Juniper and Thunder have found themselves in Greenest. They've discovered that oppression is a much more ambiguous thing than they had previously imagined, and that the life of a wandering hero is considerably more challenging than life in the Hollow. Juniper is embarrassed to admit that he's had to resort to petty theft to keep himself fed and housed, though he hastens to add that he makes sure to only steal from people that look like they have a surplus of wealth, and that those people are probably oppressing the common people anyway.
