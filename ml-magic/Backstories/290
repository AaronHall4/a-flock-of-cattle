Waterdhavian Noble's Bastard whose step-father loathes him, and as he begins rising in the ranks of the army and gaining recognition, panics and enters into a pact with Malkizid (fallen solar who hates elves) to curse the character and cause him to destroy his comrades (possessed by Malk). The remnants of Malkizid's power have granted him the powers of a warlock. So his reason for adventuring is a self-exile and a quest to learn what the hell happened to him and his brothers in arms.
