Úlfhéðnar was named by his father after the sacred warriors of Odin. Murals and songs of great, barbarous warriors in wolf skins were the stories passed onto the growing dwarf. He was raised with a firm hand and stout ale for the first fifty years of his life in clan Stormurgerir (Stormrend).
He would spend the next century of his life fighting in many battles, and braving the wild under the mountain and above, for the honor of his kinsmen and dwarf kind at large. Stormurgerir is an undermountain tribe of nomads that transverse untamed underlands, valleys, and mountain ranges. There, they face the forces of nature with a mutually grim respect. A Stormurgerir is the alpha predator and recognizes no greater hunter.
Úlfhéðnar hopes to honor his father in all things that he does. In keeping with this, he seeks truly worthy foes of dwarven kind so that he may live and die with valor. Death for courageous Stormurgerir is the welcoming of an old ally and an invitation to the halls of one's forefathers in the great beyond. Úlfhéðnar wakes before dawn, brushing snow from his tunic and sharpening his blade, each day in hopes of achieving a valorous and honorable death. Until then, he will harness the fury of his fathers, telling tales of the Stormurgerir to the wind in the swinging of his axe.
