"Insert name here" was a skilled tracker/bounty hunter with many years of experience working for high profile clients. She however met her untimely end at the hands of a necromancer, but not before returning a great number of his creations to death.
After death, the Raven Queen offered her a unique chance to return to the Material Plane. She would become her disciple and seek out and destroy the undead and those who would disturb the natural order of death. And maybe one day she would have the chance to bring vengeance upon the necromancer who ended her life.
Reborn a Knight of the Raven Queen, she now wanders the land seeking out the undead and their masters. The one drawback is that she remembers nothing of her previous life, only her service to her Queen. Overtime she will regain some of her memories as she becomes more powerful.
