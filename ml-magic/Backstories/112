The third and youngest son of a duke, Reynard is a 'spare son'. This means that he got all the benefits of being a noble, without the responsibilities, albeit at the cost of not being a heir and being destined for political marriage.
When the big day came, Reynard was set out to marry some chinless girl from a very good family. Unfortunately, being a rather.... hedonistic and rowdy fellow, his bachelor party got a bit out of hand; there was an incident involving three prostitutes, a boy and a goat. When word came out, the wedding was called off and, now being useless to the family, Reynard was disowned.
So Reynard set out for a life of adventure, figuring that was the best way to have fun. He is incredibly haughty and arrogant, disdainful of commoners but his reputation among the nobility is too awful to get as much as an audience with a minor noble.
