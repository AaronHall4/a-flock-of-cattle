grizzled poor old hunter who's basically turning into this Grunkle Stan-like character. His whole thing is that he was a hunter who lived alone after he went out adventuring with his friends and they were all killed. Survivor's guilt was strong, so he lived alone for a long time until he met his wife Myriani, an elven apothecary, while he was hunting and she was gathering.
Once, she became ill and sent him out to get the right fungus for her treatment, but the remedy fungus was very similar to the correct fungus and he used the wrong one when he returned and poisoned his wife. Alcoholism sets in and he lost contact with his only son.
He sort of got conscripted into the adventuring party (St. Cuthbert appeared to him in the form of his wife to get him to overthrow the cult that's taken over the nearby town), and stays "because he has to," but really doesn't want the same thing that happened to his friends to happen to the party. He is just trying to make a difference in the world before he dies, so that if he ever finds his son again, his son will be proud of him.
