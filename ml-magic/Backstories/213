Uurg loves to kill things, revels in it. Being raised by Orcs has been a blessing in his eyes. Murders, pillaging, razing... Good times, goooood times. But he started to hear stories; stories of "adventurers" who got to kill things and get paid for it. The most he ever got for killing things was an arrow in the thigh or a sword to the gut. Poor payment in his estimation. So he set out to see if the rumors were true, and it turned out to be the best decision he ever made.
