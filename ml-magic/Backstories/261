raised within the orc kingdom (if you will) by his half-orc parents until a shift in leadership was leading to a return to the old ways and the slaughter of non-pure orcs. His family and several others who were either half-orcs or did not agree fled to form a new settlement on the outskirts where things get really wild.
There were trade caravans that passed nearby so they'd often raid the traders to supplement the meager living they could manage in the crags. Then they raided the wrong caravan, slavers decimated them and either killed or enslaved everyone they came across. My character ended up being sold off to some bandits as a pit fighter. That's where he spent a lot of his child hood. Then a band of mercenaries were hired to wipe out the bandits and my character had two choices, go on his own or join the mercenaries. He chose the safety in numbers route.
