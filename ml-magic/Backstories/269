Horace grew up with his adopted family. The one he calls his parents are owners of a jewelry store and live a pretty simple life. His parents could not have any children of their own and so when, one day, a baby showed up on their doorstep with a note "Please love and care for me!", they were overwhelmed with joy. While his parents are only human it was clear Horace had some Elven blood in him as he had ears with pointed tips and easily picked up the language from local Elven children. One day a thief attempted to rob the store and Horace stopped the thief with a ray the spewed frost. As time crept by other traits began to appear, such as tiny white scales on his body, and other magical powers. His parents advised him to take a journey to discover his true origins. Thus Horace took his first steps into adventure.
