He was raised by the human side of his family with his father in a small town near a stream. He heard of a large spider who terrorized his town in the night and went to investigate one night. He approached the spider while it was asleep and swiftly cut its legs off. The next morning he showed the towns people and they treated him as a town hero and told him to go out and find adventure. He moved from tavern to tavern playing songs looking for gold. One day he met another hero whos soul had been taken by a trickster god and had to get another gods blessing to get it back. They adventured together for a little while and eventually found a god. He granted the other adventuer his soul. He told me I could have anything I want so I chose the ability to switch between Half-Elf and Githyanki.
