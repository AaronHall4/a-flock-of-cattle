I was an orphan on the streets tried to steal from some who was too clever for me he adopted me and took me in. discovered his secret of being a grifter(con-man drifter) and soon began teaching me the tools of the trade. me and him were a team going from city to city tricking dukes and peasants alike for their goods then fleeing to the next town. til we were caught in the act by a stranger with "golden eyes" and were being tied to trees and covered in tar and set on fire for our crimes for the town to see. as they showered my father with boiling hot tar He look right at me without flinching at the pain and told me "they are all fools Darin you will show them I know you will" And closed his eyes and accepted death I struggled and cried and cursed god I begged for mercy I begged for salvation I begged for freedom. to which in that instance I went into a trance my eyes turned black I could only see Darkness, As if from all around me a booming voice echoed a word. "REBIRTH" At soon as those words rung in my mind black liquid a black as tar itself poured from every pour in my body i convulsed. just as the guards began to approach me in curious that their prisoner was dying of some disease, everything went silent and Tentacles shot out from my body like and explosion, in every direction killing everyone around me witnessing the horrid display, destroying my bindings, the trees around me, it disintegrated my father and I fainted. when I awoke surrounded by the death and destruction, a giant tome lied before me covered in horrors that were whispering that word "rebirth" but not aloud but within my mind. it was an experience one could never describe, but it felt like it was apart of me now. I grabbed it and ran. I was free but a wanted man with a new terrible secret that I knew nothing about. it was a fear greater than death.
