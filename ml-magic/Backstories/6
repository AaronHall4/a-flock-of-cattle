Nok Flameborn Kagalano was the first of his tribe born free from the oppression of the red dragon Vaznerakoth. The dragon had enslaved the tribe for as long as even the elders could remember, until a fateful meteor came streaking down and slew him atop the mountain he had claimed. A fire shall forever burn where Vaz's body lies as if the flame were the tombstone of this once great being.
After that, Nok's tribe began to pseudo worship the rock. They emulated its fall from the heavens with their combat technique, and even developed skills to harness the flame that had touched them all.
Though they were free, the tribe was not destined to survive. The dragon had left them with too few numbers to repopulate. As Nok laid the last elder to rest, he began a quest to search for another tribe, and to liberate all who were held captive by any and all draconic rulers.
