Malcore The Magnificent, given name Jim Fuddly, ambitiously seeks to become a great performer in the Capital. Malcore the Magnificent was born to a family of vegetable farmers growing turnips, squashes, carrots,potatoes, and cabbages. Malcore’s parents are named Judy and Frank Fuddly, and he has an older brother name Frank Jr who is inheriting the farm. Jim always hated being a farmer and felt looked down upon wanted to leave Brownhill their village.
One day a troupe of performers came to Brownhill. They wore colorful clothes and spoke like Capital folk. They were fun and entertaining. Jim was enthralled with Drake Dangerous sword swallower, juggler, and knife thrower. He wrote a note in the dirt outside his home “Gone to Capital with Drake Dangerous. -Jim”.
He never did make it to the Capital. He started out as a porter with the troupe and eventually earn a position as Drake’s assist. Drake gave him the name Malcore the Magnificent and made him work on his accent so he doesn't sound country anymore. Drake taught him the knife trade and hidden arts. Malcore the Magnificent hasn't mastered the hidden arts yet, but he feels close too. When Drake Dangerous passed away he decided to leave the small troupe.
Jim thinks he should develop a hero and explorer persona to help him get into the Capital scene. A freaking gold Dragonborn ask me for directions to frontier because I'm well travelled. I told her I was heading to Fulgrum’s Folly and she could join me. Turns out she is a paladin. She'd make a nice sidekick in my adventure stories.
