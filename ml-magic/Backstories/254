an exiled prince/noble who's step mother dominated his father's mind for years, removed key members of his court through assassination or banishment. Then her eldest son killed my characters sister and framed his father. When my character confronted his father he was magically charmed/enraged and took his father's sword and killed him. When he was released from the charm he saw what he did to then see his step mother and three step brothers who gladly boast of what they have done and then call for the guards. My character then escapes with his father sword by jumping into the river. He is rescued by a paladin miles down the river who he goes with and trains to become a paladin. My character then takes the oath of vengeance to avenge his family. All the while he carries his father's sword with him but will never use it over the guilt of his actions and he is obsessively protective of it. He is also distrustful of arcane magic users and hates any form of mind domination spells like charm or dominate person.
