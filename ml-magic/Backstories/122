Rando was the son of two incredibly powerful wizards and he and his two brothers each rebeled in their own way. The Amazing Rando picked almost entirely non-combat spells and wanted to become a stage magician. His parents were so disappointed in him because they harnessed powerful magics to save the world and he used most of his magic performing tricks that could have also been done with slight of hand.
