Julius entered the church at a young age, orphaned by an undead attack. One simple zombie basically killed his whole family, before some nice men in clanking, shiny armor killed the zombie in one blow, and took him back with them. Now he's older and he's learned the ways of the Church of Kelemvor- from the position of a janitor and chef, mostly, but he's picked up a few magic prayers that'll help him out. One day, his town is attacked by Orcs, and he's sent out on an important mission- to run for his life- by the local Priest. Now he thinks he's an inquisitor, as typically inquisitors run around for most of their lives, so clearly that's what the priest meant by that. Might as well make it a High Inquisitor, since he seems to be the only one around, and that makes him the best.
