I used to be acolyte at a temple of Bahamut. I started looking at some dark magic and wanted to learn more about it, but got kicked out of my order. I vowed to exact revenge. I became so bitter that I actually wanted to become a god myself
Eventually my patron contacted me and offered me power. I accepted and here I am.
