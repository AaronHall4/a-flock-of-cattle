His father, Joseph Rico, believed himself infertile and clever enough to trick a devil. Gambled away the soul of his first-born child for warlock pact powers. Thinking he had beat a devil at its own game, celebrated with his then wife Elhonna, an elf barmaid. Intimacies later, when Elhonna announced she was pregnant several weeks later, Joseph left. He never wanted children.
When Rinn was nine years old, he showed the touch of the arcane and was sent to the boarding school in the city Ostwick, The Ostwick School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In his first-year class under the study of Professor Hogwarts, his first week's presentation was to use Prestidigitation to light a candle. Instead, a 5th-level Fireball went off, killing everyone in the room except for himself and Professor Hogwarts.
Initially believed to be an act of terror, Rinn was investigated and charged with murder and terrorism. With the first-hand testimony of Professor Hogwarts, he was found to have blood cursed with wild magic, and cleared of any ill intent; saved a punishment of execution. Rinn was then sent to live and study under a professional acquaintance of Professor Hogwarts and expert in wild magic surges - a gnome named Terry.
Several years of intense study and meditation practices to contain his exceptional abilities, Rinn had become somewhat of a quiet and withdrawn sorcerer.
One day Terry received a letter from his esteemed colleague Gundren Rockseeker in need of help delivering some goods through somewhat hostile territory. Rinn offered immediately to go in Terry's stead, after receiving a letter from his mother Elhonna with information on his fatherless upbringing, and the name Joseph Rico.
Rinn now adventures, fighting evil and helping the helpless, with two questions burning in his mind; Where is Joseph Rico, and why am I cursed?
