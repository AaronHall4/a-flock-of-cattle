For a long time, Lanval was just another acolyte at the local temple to Oghma. He wasn't trained as a cleric or a paladin; he just studied the texts and performed the rites as instructed to. Life was simple. However, one night he had a troubling dream: a figure calling itself Tempus commanded him to rise up as his champion, and a few days later he started to display sorcerous powers. Now looked at a bit askance by his peers at the temple, Lanval left to just try and figure out why the heck he was now Tempus's "champion" and what that even meant when Tempus never seemed to say anything back to him.
