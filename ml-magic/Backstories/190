At the age of 10 Johnny survived terrible fire that burned down village, he was the only survivor. From now on Johnny was scared of fire, he was even scared to look at it.
After that he was living in a Temple and learning to be a priest. When Johnny turned 18, he decided to start an adventuring life. He found some people to adventure with.
After telling them his story, they told him that, it is said that kids who survived a fire are the Chosen of Maltazar, lawful evil god of fire. People say that he often starts fires to find the "strongest".
Johnny didn't belive in such nonsense but after that talk, after 8 years of fear he stared at bonfire, and the fire stared back.
