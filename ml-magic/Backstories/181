He was once a legend. He is in books and histories, but that was centuries ago. He extended his age through magic, and he has been retired for so long that he finds he has forgotten most of his magic.
He sets out into the world to regain his fame and power, but he is much older and weaker now so it will be slow going. He is constantly frustrated by the daily reminders that he is no longer well known and his power is now nothing special.
