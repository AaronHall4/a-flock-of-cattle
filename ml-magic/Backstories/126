home was was destroyed by a rampaging horde of orcs and goblins (he's not an orphan though). he fought in many wars from a young age to defend what was left of his homeland and has a dense hatred of all orcs and goblins because he witnessed the horrors they brought with them. He is neutral good but he doesn't shy away from doing bad things, like tracking down and executing a drow who had just previously won a trial by combat, and torturing prisoners when no-one was looking. I think as a character he may be losing his sanity.
