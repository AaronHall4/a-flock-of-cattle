Jim always wanted to be in the magic business, so he was thrilled at becoming an accountant for the prestigious Magic Inc. But what he thought would be an opportunity for magic and professional growth turned out to be slog where he desperately filed away pages of spells for his high-level wizard superiors. He was always looked down upon for just being a peon, never bound for greatness himself. The wizards always glorified how cool the life of adventure is, filling Jim with envy and disparity. But one day, Jim discovered that one page for a cantrip submitted for filing was actually printed twice... so he took it and studied, and learned he really did have a talent for magic! So he concocted his plan: stay at the firm just long enough to collect enough copies of spells before he could strike it out on his own. Eventually, he formed his own spellbook (a stapled together loose-collection of stolen company property) and quit his job to helm his own magic start up, Goldstein Arcanic Enterprises, GAE for short.
Now he roams the land, trying to build his business and invite fellow adventurers to join his GAE community. Picking up the adventurers on the side to acquire additional funding and networking. And forever looking over his shoulder for the prestigious wizards of Magic Inc. hunting him down for stolen company assets.
