Argoth was a soldier in the armies of Komra, the Goddess of Battle. He became stricken with violent madness and a lust for blood which got him kicked out of the army. Desperate, he prayed to the darkness for relief, and Armokhorne answered.
Argoth became a follower of the Blood God, restraining his impulses until battle was joined. Then he became a whirlwind, savagely tearing into his enemies with all his strength.
