He served his king faithfully, fighting against the might of an oppressive empire seeking to claim his lands, and was famed for his control over battle and his magical shield.
He participated in many battles, but was ultimately defeated when a foreign knight used a powerful sword that phased through his armor, tearing up the left side of his torso. He fell to the ground, the enemy knight claiming his shield, and he was rushed to a healer. The healer was inexperienced, and the healing left horrible scar tissue covering his torso, limiting his movements and ending his career as a knight.
Now, his life of glory over, he spends his time in taverns lamenting not having a better healer, drinking, only occasionally whoring, and longing for adventure. In place of leveling up, he's slowly getting over his injuries, allowing him to preform feats he could only do in his glory days.
