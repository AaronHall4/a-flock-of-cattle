A member of a tribe of barbarians who are very passionate about fine dining. With her giant cleaver, she wanders the realm trying to find new, tantalizing recipes for all the beasties she slays. With her limited literacy she tries her best to write them down in her own cookbook. Basically your "stereotypical barbarian" save for being extremely passionate and snobbish about cuisine and table manners.
