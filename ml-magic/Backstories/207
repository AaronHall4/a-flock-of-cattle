Violeskus was nothing but a petty thief in his homeland. If you needed some small amount of treasure swiped, he was your man. However one day he was caught, and due to the harsh laws in his country, he was sentenced to death.
So he sat in an overcrowded jail cell for a week, awaiting his fate. But one day, somehow the cell door opened and prisoners poured out of their confines, starting a full blown riot. Violeskus was unarmed, and never was good with his fists, so he ran like the Nine Hells.
He barely escaped the compound with a bit of luck, and perhaps even the gods smiling on him. He hid in the dark corners of the city for days. The emperor declared any fugitives were to be killed on sight. (and secretly the guards knew that the more grisly it was, the better) So Violeskus knew he had to escape the country. Again fortune shined in his favor and he miraculously slipped out of the city and then by the border.
And so Violeskus found himself in new territory. He didn't have contacts, sure, but he had something much better. Freedom. Without the confines of his oppressive government, he could steal much easier and from much wealthier people. And so Violeskus vowed that one day he'd become the greatest thief that ever lived.
