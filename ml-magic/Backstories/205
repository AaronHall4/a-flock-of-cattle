Kierlienne was orphaned at an early age, and found herself struggling for survival in the streets of Baren. A wiry high elven girl, she learned how to look after herself, and put her own interests first. However as time went on, and with some guidance, she sought to help those less fortunate than her, establishing herself as a common name among the unwanted peoples of Baren. Her golden hair, narrowly slanted eyes, and peaceful smile were unmistakable. Hard to catch, even harder to dislike, she produced in half a generation of lost children in the city a moral code. Her crowning jewel to it all is that the least harm that can be done, will be done. Kierlienne hopes her resolve is never tested by the need to kill someone.
