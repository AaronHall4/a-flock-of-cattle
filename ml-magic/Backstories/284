he was part of a noble eleven family, but due to her half-breededness, her father made her a servant, while her full Elven sister was a born sorceress. Her whole family wielded magic while she was born with only the power to persuade people (high charisma) and eventually she got fed up. She went into the woods and found a mysterious patron who offered her the magic she always wanted if she killed her family, and so with her new powers she murdered them all, but realizing what the implications of this was, she fled. Now she keeps her new magic in her emerald focus around her neck and she uses her powers of enchantment and persuasion to make people work for her, making herself a self-made unofficial noble. Her goal is to one day become the queen she always desired, enchanting whoever gets in her way of her neutral evil self. She's not crazy, just pragmatic, and wants to keep peace, so long as it's her peace!
