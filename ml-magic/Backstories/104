Arkimia Archleone never had enough, growing up. She never went hungry, at least not too hungry, or too cold in the winter, but for her it was never enough. Too proud to beg and for that line of work, she became a fence for stolen goods, starting small at first, but gradually working her way up to mid-sized goods.
Things went well until the old need for more, always more, came back. As a tiefling, she had some skill for magicks in her blood, and so she kept the next tome on magic that came her way, thinking of becoming a wizard.
It was not that sort of book.
That night, in her sleep, some thing visited her, offered her the power to take what she wished, if she only swore to its service. She did so happily, and when she woke it was to the feeling of power filling her skull, burning like fire.
She doesn't regret becoming what she is, but wonders what her new boss - not master, never master - wants.
