joined a troupe as a tumbler, actor and dancer. The troupe consisted of four halflings and a gnome, and frequently faced violent hecklers. My character often played swordfighters and decided to hit two birds with one stone by actually learning how to fight from a similarly dextrous and lightfooted wood elf. His roles became more convincing, and the group found themselves a bodyguard. He periodically left the troupe to receive more training, and since the last time they have dissappeared. He is now travelling the world looking for them, with only a poem as a clue.
