Gaeus Jule is your average warrior. He was raised in a shack by a family that was at one point middle class, but with the financial burden of a child, they fell into poverty. His parents raised him to be honest and kind, and he was gentle and softspoken during his childhood. At age 17, he was drafted into the King's army to repel the invading orcs. He became a war hero, earning 21 medals by the end of combat for feats of bravery and sacrifice. He was the sole survivor from his unit. After that, he became even more reserved, traveling home and staying with his parents in that shack until they passed away, and continuing to live there after it began to rot. He is 47 now, and suffers from severe ptsd. He hardly sleeps, and when he does it can't be against a wall--anything could be hiding behind it. Every sound sets him on edge, and though he is still trusting (with a good standing in the nearby city) he resorts to violence all too often. He recognizes these flaws and hates himself for It. hes taken up sword once again, and a few trinkets from his old platoon. His only desperate quest now is to find someone to bring back his Friends. necromancy, gods, deals with the devil--his own life doesn't matter, he's lived in hell long enough.
