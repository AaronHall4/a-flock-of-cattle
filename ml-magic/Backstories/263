very go getting type of person. Always up for an adventure(I want to make this into a type of flaw, where my character is so quick to accept an adventure that he doesnt think about it), never turning a cheek. His parents were killed as an infant when his village was attacked. Luckily he was saved by someone, never able to figure out who, and since he was only a baby he doesn't really remember anything about the attack so his parents death never really bothered him. Growing up he was always told of legends and fairy tales of adventures, and how they slayed giant creatures no man would ever dare face. Because of this, he always dreamt of becoming an adventurer himself and trained to become one.
Once he was of age(i think around 115 years old), he set for his own joirney to make a name for himself. Throughout the years he went on quests and missions, none to big just simple ones such as slay the goblins bothering the village or go fetch a sacred item stolen from a noble person. One day, while on a mission, he was betrayed by a man from his party and because of it everyone but the man who betrayed him and roy rogers himself survived. Because of this, he has trusting issues and has a very hard time telling anyone anyone of his past life. Fast foward a few years and he is at the same inn that everyone else that his future party(other players) are currently at, when a strangemen set them all on a quest that would change their lives for ever.
