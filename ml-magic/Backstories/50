A scout in the dwarven army, he was captured during a campaign against the Duergar.  His company, under the command of the young prince, suffered a horrible loss after his capture.  When called to account for the loss of 800 dwarven lives, the prince blamed the scouts who never returned.  One of them must have betrayed them. When Drohvan was finally able to escape, he made it back to his people, only to be arrested on sight.  They believed he had betrayed them, and his "escape" was just him returning to spy on them.  He was branded a coward and a traitor (literally, dwarven runes branded on his face) and exiled.  He found work on a ship that didn't ask too many questions, but after a night of heavy drinking, he woke up in an alley, the ship was gone, and his pack was left on the dock. With nowhere to go, he meets the rest of the party.
