She was raised in the Underdark and learned guitar from a young age. Being quite spontaneous and hyperactive even as she grew, music helped her to focus her mind and be able to think carefully about things. However, once she grew into adulthood she realised that her calling was not with the malevolent beings in the Underdark, so she managed to pull her way out of the Abyss and find a way to the surface world.
Once she arrived, she had only the clothes and guitar on her back, and began to perform for money and board. An old Bard heard of her exploits and summoned her to his home where she studied the art of Bard spellcasting, and created short chords she could play to cast spells. She continued to travel around, doing odd jobs for adventurers and performing until the current day.
