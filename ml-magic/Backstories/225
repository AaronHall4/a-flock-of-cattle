Delphendir's parents were both killed when he was only 7 years old. One was human, the other elven, and their love considered an abomination by the Thranish government. They lived in Thaliost during the Last War, until the city, the shining jewel of Aundair, was captured after a year-long siege.
He hid his halfness, lest the oppressive Thranes slaughter him for the difference. Delphendir made his life begging for four years after his parents were killed.
His story would be like so many others in the world that it was almost a joke, a parody of its own banality, had he only seen his parents executed.
But he hadn't. So it wasn't.
When Delphendir was 12 he found his mother. She was never killed. Instead, she praised the Silver Flame deeply and had absolutely no recollection of his father. She had been turned to a husk.
This spurred him to search for his father. At age 14, Delphendir found him. The War was still going strong, and espionage between Aundair and Thrane was quite popular. Delphendir's father got mixed into this, working for Aundair and delivering them information from Thaliost. And, hating Delphendir's mother.
