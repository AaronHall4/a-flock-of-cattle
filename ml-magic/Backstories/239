Part of an order of paladins hundreds of years past, he fought in a holy war under the banner of the platinum dragon, Bahamut, against undead armies raised by a powerful lich. Through an act of self-sacrifice, he saved a great many of his comrades in arms, but fell in battle.
Now, hundreds of years later, his spirit is brought before the feet of the Raven Queen. She informs him that although his order succeeded in defeating the lich's armies, the lich himself is still alive somehow, and is growing once again in power. Through his actions, he was noticed and chosen to return to the material plane and finish what he started.
Lucas finds himself breathing once more, reborn into the domain of the Raven Queen - The Shadowfell. With only vague memories of his past and a holy quest to complete, he returns to the world to recover his strength and finish what he started.
