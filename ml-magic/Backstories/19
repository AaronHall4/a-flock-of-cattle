She was born in the beautifully multi ethnic utopian city of Silverymoon, where she spent her childhood as an obsessively perfectionistic overachiever clinging to the rules with a desperation that bordered on insanity in an attempt to suppress her burning desire for something more, the futility of which was revealed when the misplacement of a single shoe led to a breakdown as she questioned the ultimate supremacy of order for the first time in her rigid life, whereupon she abandoned family and friends and fled to the mountains to find that living in the wild with animals made her happier than she had ever been before; eventually, she renounced her vow to never interact with any member of a sapient species again after discovering a shiny necklace on a corpse floating down the river and falling in love with man-made shiny things, and now, believing that she has attained Enlightenment, she travels a relatively small fraction of the world looking for more shiny things, novel experiences, and opportunities to refine her belief system
