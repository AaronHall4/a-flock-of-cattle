My mom is like a drunk farmer. We actually got her a pet goat so she'd milk it before her first beer of the day. My dad on the other hand makes wagon wheels. They're ok, I guess. But this fucking town is really, really boring. Luckily, my grandfather left me this rusty sword, so I figure why not get the hell out of this shithole town.
