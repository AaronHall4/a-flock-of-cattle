an initiate to an order of true neutral monks who are basically "grey Jedi" keepers of the balance (they will help you take back or defend your homeland but if you try to strike back they will just as readily turn on you). He is on a pilgrimage of indeterminate length for saving a life that should not have been saved. He is being punished for intervening and upsetting the balance. He is tasked with observing the world and only interfering when good and evil or law and chaos (civilization and nature) are out of balance. He is obviously bad at this.
