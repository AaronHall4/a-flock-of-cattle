Meen, a half-orc, would never be truly accepted into the tribe he hailed from, and his father refused to be disgraced and accept Meen as his son.
From there, Meen was accepted into the monastery by the friendly monks, even though he was a half-orc. As Meen's young life progressed, the monks watched him fail again and again in his studies of scripture, but excel in martial arts.
Then came the day when Meen grew curious about his family. He had not even known a name, as the elders only addressed him as "young one". Meen asked his fellow students at the monastery about his namesake, and overheard one of them whisper "Mean son-of-a-bitch". The other students broke into laughter, and on that day, Meen was truly born.
After several years of failing even the most basic scripture exams at the monastery, Meen was finally exiled until he could return with a relic sacred to the monks. Of course, the relic he was sent to search for did not exist, but Meen's 5 intelligence didn't help him figure that out.
Now, Meen wanders the world in search of holy artifacts and his long-lost family, hoping to finally find his place in the world. He demands to be addressed as Meen, son of Abich, to honor his "family name".
