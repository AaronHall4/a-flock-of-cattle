He started life doing typical gnomey things, but after hearing a tale from a wandering adventurer, decided that adventure was exactly what he was missing. So he set out, looking for high risk, high reward situations. During one adventure, he ended up obtaining a sentient maul with a female personality, whose name is Thunderclap. Thunderclap communicates telepathically, and, being highly opinionated, frequently argues with Leonal. So it tends to look like Leonal is ranting and raving at himself when actually he's talking to his maul. Leonal is the Guild Master of one of 3 local guild, his is called the Burning Oath, which he took over after its founder retired. He treats everyone who joins as family and is very protective of them. He's exceptionally good natured, but once he's pushed too far, look out. And he's got the power to back himself up. He is one of the most powerful people in my world.
