She was abandoned as a child and adopted by a nearby gnome clan. Her spells are primarily evocation spells (destruction, fire, electricity) and in this world that's rare- gnome sorcerers almost always are illusionists. The clan pushed her out when her anger started getting the better of her and things would spontaneously catch fire.
She's easily corruptible and may one day learn why the dark side comes naturally to her.
