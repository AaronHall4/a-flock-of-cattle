I was the right hand man of Aerael de Lacosta, leader of the Rising Suns, as we battled against the tyrannical reign of Emperor Bulgariss for the Kingdom of Trussika. During a particularly difficult campaign I, along with a dozen villagers of Greenhope I was helping to escape, was ambushed by a force of fifty imperial soldiers.

Carrying little but a simple shield and my grandfather’s rapier, I stood against them, holding them off for as long as I could. I cut down nearly two dozen of them, but had significant wounds for my troubles. I expected that this would be the end for me.

As I was run through by what I had assumed was a fatal blow, a beam of pure sunlight blazed down from the sky. Through the  piercing glare of this blinding light, as I was enveloped into it, I saw the face of an angel of the goddess of purity. She told me that my time was not yet, and that there was work yet to do. She gave me only a single admonition to persevere.

Thus restored, I found my wounds healed, and my mind clear as I returned to myself, with a circle of scorched earth surrounding my feet. The soldiers, astonished at the sudden display of godly power, had stepped back, yet still had their weapons at the ready. 

I watched in fascination as, at my very will, my grandfather’s sword enveloped in radiant fire, white tongues of flame licking up the blade with a piercing glow. The blade had been transformed into that blade of legend, the Radiant Ambulai.

The soldiers steeled themselves, but I could see the fear in their eyes, battling with their unjust orders to take the village. With a sudden smile on my face, I taunted them with brazen confidence - “Come on.”
