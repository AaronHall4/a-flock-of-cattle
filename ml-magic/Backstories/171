Sons of Nobility, from eldest to youngest, are commonly summarised as such,
"The Heir, The Prayer; The Spare"
Being the Third Son of the long and prestigious Ainsme Family, Gethbe, could have lived his entire life in decadence and debauchery, sponging off his family's extremely substantial income. Unlike his elder brothers, he was not beholden to inherit the family's duty on King assigned lands. Nor was he expected to ingratiate his family with the church by entering seminary. He was, after all, The Spare.
Had Providence not intervene, Gethbe might have very well led the cushy life of a noble with no responsibilities. From a young age, Gethbe has had it easy. Performing just well enough in his studies to be allowed a carefree existence. Until the day the dragons came.
After the Embers cooled, The various social stratum just kept to their own. The commoners helped their neighbours. The nobles handed out only as much as they were dutied, and only to those registered within their district. Preferring instead to busy themselves with the restoration of their estates and rose gardens before their next fÃªte. None would come to the aid of the destitute and dispossessed. Only the Knights of Illmatar would extend salvation to all.
Impressed by their altruistic nature, an adolescent Gethbe learnt the true meaning of "Noblesse Oblige". Seeing the impact of these Paladins, Gethbe also saw a way for him to leave a lasting legacy. A way much more productive compared to a life of luxury; to the vehement objection of his father.
Years later, picking up a shield emblazoned with his family's Crest and a Warhammer topped with the symbol of Illmater, Gethbe snuck out one sleepy night.
Venturing forth on his mission of Goodness, Salvation, and Justice for all, Gethbe is determined to carve the Ainsme family name, deep into the annals of heroic history.
