One day his tribe decided to raid the nearby village of haflings. They hire three human heroes for getting stuff back and getting revenge.
The heroes were a wizard, a paladin, and a fighter, all epic and noble warps of Tyr.
The heroes made very short work of Bogo's tribe. In the end Bogo was cringing and cowering. The fighter wanted to kill him because he's a goblin and will just keep plundering. The paladin said spare him because he's begging for his life. The wizard says "I'll handle this." He hours epic on his gaes and recites the conditions:
You will be a noble representative of Tyr until he becomes god of the dead.
So they take Bogo with them and he apprentices for a while under the wizard until he is required to go forth.
Bogo was a good super pious character that isn't a cleric/paladin. Uses seedy methods to fight for the maimed Lord and prestidigitations to teach his word.
