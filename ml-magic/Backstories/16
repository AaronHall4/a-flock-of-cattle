After an encounter with a dark panther in the middle of the woods as a child, Kavalor realized that he was a Sorcerer with the ability to perform wild magic. For years after he lived in his small town going about his life as best he could, but always trying to find a way to help out his town with his unique abilities.
Until one day, a day that he refuses to speak of, for as he tried to help with the construction of a new house in the town, he accidentally produced a fireball that not only destroyed the house, but also everyone working on in and in the surrounding areas, including his mother and father. 
‘Luckily’, a fallen section of roof protected Kavalor from the worst of the heat, but after his wounds had healed and he was able to walk again, he left town, unable to face his old friends with what he’d done.
And so, Kavalor Brimsdune wanders from town, to city, trying to find a way to repent for all the deaths he caused. From time to time he may use his magic, but because of the deaths and memories it is associated with, he feels very guilty and apprehensive when he does. All he wants to do is help people, and make a name for himself of which he can be proud.
