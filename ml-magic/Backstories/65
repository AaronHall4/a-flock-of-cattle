Baer Stonekeg was the son of a noble dwarf family who owned and operated Stonekeg brewery. Baer loved to drink the ale and bask in the decadence his family amassed, but he grew tired. He began to learn to fight, and his mentors quickly realized he was quite talented. Baer left his family's estate to fight in a war but when the fighting was over, Baer found he was not. So Baer wondered the land in search of a battle and a worthy cause to lend his Axe to. Eventually the land became peaceful and there was no war to fight, but fight was all Baer could do. He joined a group of mercenaries called the Red Hand and did things he wasn't proud of. It wasn't like war, there was no cause just money. When Baer decided it was time for him to go home, the leaded I'd the red hand would not let him leave. After a long battle Baer struck down his former mentor and boss. When he finally returned home everything was gone. The house and the bar were in rubble and there was no sign of his family. Instead of shedding a tear he left to do the only thing he knew how- fight.
