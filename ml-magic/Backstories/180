His parents’ love affair was rare, and the boys (Giamarga who passed at first but were obviously only half-Vistani as they grew older) were quickly outcast when the truth was discovered. The twins and their mother traveled almost continuously throughout their later childhood, setting up camp in towns as they saw fit and performing for gold to make ends meet, Tamás on his fiddle and Tobar on his flute. One night when Tamás and Tobar were older children, Tobar was abducted from their camp in a seemingly random act of cruelty. Since then, Tamás has decided that life has no destiny, great purpose, or guiding principles. When he came of age, he set out to find adventure in the secret hope that it would one day randomly reunite him with his twin. Following the god Fharlanghn and never content to stay in one place, he believes Tobar is still out there somewhere. To his companions, he comes off as simply a fickle and unsatisfied thrill-seeker who leaps before he looks and doesn't think about the consequences beyond the reward. His past is rarely, if ever, shared with those around him.
