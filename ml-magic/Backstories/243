when he was a 5 year old kid he and some other villager kids got kidnapped by a cult. As he was there he and the other kids got saved just in time by a powefull wizard named Usador the blue, as a result of all the magic the wizard threw around my charachter developed magic. Normal childhood after being rescuid and constantly being told how lucky he is and gratefull he should be + traveling bards stories makes him want to leave the village to becoe a hero like the wizard who saved him and find the wizard and thank him for saving him.
Basicly he is a lv one sorcerer who travels the world in an atemt to be a hero while also looking for one spesific wizard just so he can thank him for saving him as a kid
