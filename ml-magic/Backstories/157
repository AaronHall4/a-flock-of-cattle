used to live at a monastery with absolutely bland and tasteless food. One day she saves a merchant from a pack of wolves and they share a meal together. The food was so delicious that she decided to leave the monastery and travel the world, sampling each and every meal that exists. You can probably guess what this would do to her waistline so I intended to play her as a tanky monk.
