A 7 and a half foot tall half orc, a brewer in a former life. He was captured by cultists whilst out picking ingredients for his latest brew and had his very memories plucked from his mind.
The cultists kept him locked up and would use mind control magics on him whenever they needed defending or menial tasks done, he knew he was due a task whenever he heard someone say "ah just get 'im to do it instead". Locked in his cell for 5 years, he only ever managed to regain his memories of being a master brewer and nothing more.
When ever possible he would steal books and scrolls from the cultists when being lead back to his cell, just to keep his mind sharp. Applying his ample intelligence, he used the pilfered reading materials to slowly teach himself the ways of magic as the years passed. Starting with whisps of smoke working up to actual spell casting with day after day of study alone in his dark dungeon (thank fuck for dark vision and inattentive cultists!)
He was eventually freed when a party of adventurers attacked the cultists by surprise, killing most of them in their sleep, the rest fleeing. The adventurers set him free after taking pity on the tormented soul. When they asked his name he simply replied: "They called me 'Im" Finally tasting freedom, he now roams from town to town in the hope that someone will recognize him but to no avail so far. He still seeks the remaining cultists and intends to finish what the adventurers started.
He passes the time on his travels picking new ingredients to add to one of the 6 small brew barrels he carries on his belt, a new ale always being perfected or tweaked.
