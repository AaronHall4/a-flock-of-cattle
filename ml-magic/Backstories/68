Richard had been the town prodigy. He was smart, strong, fast, and had a good heart. He would give his last copper to a homeless man with a smile, and he dearly loved his mentor, a ranger who had taught him much.
Then the ranger took ill. Richard traveled far to find the tree whose bark could save his mentor. Finding it, he climbed high, for only the fresh, young shoots at the top could be ground into the healing salve. As he neared the top, one of the branches he gripped broke under his hand. He fell, ultimately striking his head many times.
When he awoke, the last fragments of the broken branch still in his hand, much of his memory was lost. Somehow, he journeyed back to his home, but he was different. His quick wit was replaced by a dullness, his charm by blandness, and his intellect was nowhere to be found.
Still, he knew the stick in his hand could heal, and he knew someone needed healing. Sadly, he returned home too late. His mentor died hours before he returned, and very few people in town even recognized him, so much had he changed.
Richard took up wandering, but learned to fear groups of people. Whenever he was with a group, his instincts would say hr should be well-liked, but he inevitably ended up mocked or scorned. Worse, he was often completely ignored.
He also kept with him the broken bit of branch. No longer possessing his knowledge of natural remedies, but knowing the branch could have healed his mentor, Richard declared the branch 'Sticky', God of Healing.
