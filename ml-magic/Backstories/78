He came from a family of violent barbarians who fought with giants and conquered villages/towns. When he was born his parents claimed a building in one such town as a home to raise their little barbarian. Extremely uneducated they had no idea that their home was not a home but in fact a library.
Gillius spent his childhood teaching himself to read. His parents assumed he was merely spacing out, a fond past time of their own. Still they trained him to fight besides his reluctance. He watched his people commit acts of violence and it made him feel shame. He denounced violence altogether.
Over 20 years passed. He was returning to his town after a failed attempt of teaching giants to read and not try to kill him. It was not hard to see the smoke above the treeline. As Gillius came closer he heard the bellowing roar. The sight of the library on fire made his heart skip a beat. Then the sight of burnt corpses, one still holding his fathers favourite great axe.
He blanked out. Awakening some time later in a field, covered in blood and with his fathers axe in hand
