Azalea was trained in the art of assassination and spying from a young age, being sent to take out rival Dark elves and upstart duergar clan heads. In the process of these missions, she discovered a secret passage that led straight to the surface. She followed it up to the top, and there saw the surface world or the first time.

She found the grand expanse of sky to be exhillirating, and the trees were all new to her, as she wandered through the forest glade she had surfaced in. Reluctantly, she headed back into the deeps, promising to find that tunnel again. Several years later, when she was 17, she told her mother about the tunnel, which was when her mother revealed a shocking truth- She was not pure drow. Her father had been a slave that House Do'Urden had captured on a surface raid, and whom Chandra had fallen in love with.

Pulling out a small set of gear, Azalea's mother handed it over, along with a set of directions that would lead her daughter to a place of training. And, in doing so, Chandra gave her blessing for her daughter to leave for the surface, knowing full and well that it may cost them both their lives.

Azalea left, and quickly found herself at the tunnel. Once she exited, she breathed a breath of fresh air, only to discover that a band of orcs and goblins had taken over the glade. Quickly putting them to rest, The young rouge left, following the very same path her cousin before her had. Within a year, she had found the place of safety and training her father had mentioned, and now, 11 years later, she has set out for her first mission for a group know as The Harpers, headed for parts unknown!
