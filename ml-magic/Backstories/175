Billy Baynes was a simple inquisitor for the noble guard. He investigated crimes throughout the city, from burglaries to murders, and he was quite good. No one called him brilliant, but he was moving up in the world. His world was shaken, however, when a close friend and colleague was discovered murdered while working security for an event at House Diogenes, and after investigating he accused the house's lord himself of the heinous crime. Unfortunately, the lord had a solid defense and alibi, and, unable to produce enough evidence or figure out how the man could've committed the crime, Baynes was disgraced and cast out of the guard. For years he lived in exile in the hills, just thinking and trying to figure out how Lord Diogenes got away with it. Until finally... he knew. And now it was time to return.
