Little Bill Hardwood, as he is currently known, used to be a hard rock miner in a clan of mountain dwarves. Disgusted by the working conditions in the mines, he organized the miners into a union and revolted against the dwarven rulers who owned the mines. Unfortunately, the crackdown against the union was swift and brutal. Fearing for his life and/or freedom, he fled dwarven society and spent several years drinking heavily and doing what work he could find as a hired thug. His favorite weapon is a pair of ornately carved wooden axe handles that he uses as clubs.
Eventually, Hardwood fell in with a band of adventurers, where he eventually (after a bad run-in with wererats that his usually brutal attacks were ineffective against) decided to pick up a little bit of magic (Arcane Trickster) to help even the odds in future encounters
