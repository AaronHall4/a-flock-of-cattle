A presence filled the room, and a voice appeared in Balasar’s head, saying simply, “read… and know me.” Suddenly he found himself able to read these arcane texts, scouring them until he had read all he could. Through his studies he learned what the voice was, an ancient purple dragon, potentially the first of the race, who had seen the creation of Bahamut and Tiamat, and even the conception of the elemental plane. Through his reading, Balasar found a ritual that could temporarily summon the consciousness of this being, and so he made a pact with it, that it would imbue Balasar with power, however, his patron gave him a task: learn its name.
