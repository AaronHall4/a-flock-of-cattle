-Markul Milner is from a reasonably well-to-do but uninvolved family who had hopes for Markul to become a wizard, and therefore enrolled Markul as a wizard's apprentice much like how kids are sent to boarding school.
-Markul was neither talented in magic nor diligent in learning it, but possesed an overconfidence that led him to feel as if he was being held back by his teacher wizard. This led Markul to frequently steal from the wizard and constantly try spells that he had no permission to try. This, in turn, led to frequent punishment.
-Markul eventually learned to hide his feelings and make it seem like his previous shenanigans were simply a lack of maturity. Instead, he began to spy on the wizard. Doing this Markul found that the wizard was communing with Urotsukidoji, The Overfiend.
-Markul was both horrified by the prospect of making pacts with devils and furious that the wizard would hide this path to power from him. Markul continued to spy and learn about Urotsukidoji until, one night after the wizard left, Urotsukidoji spoke to him. Urotsukidoji flattered Markul's ability/ambition and told Markul that if he were to kill his wizard master, he could serve The Overfiend.
-Markul craved the power Urotsukidoji could grant him but did not actually desire to kill the wizard. Markul eventually convinced himself that killing the wizard would not actually be an evil act, since the wizard was clearly taking an evil path. Markul would instead pretend to follow the demon but plans to prevent the fiend's goals in the end.
-Markul murders the wizard and takes his place as The Overfiend's servant. This crime being committed, Markul flees his hometown.
