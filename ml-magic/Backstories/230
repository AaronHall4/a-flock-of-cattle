Grew up with the Thieves Guild with the belief that he is an orphan. In reality, his father is the royal spymaster of a nearby kingdom and his mother a privateer captain for the royal navy. His memories were sealed due to the fact that he witnessed an arcane ritual that would tear the kingdom apart if revealed to the public. His parents left him with his uncle, the tiefling guildmaster of the neighboring Thieves Guild and there he was trained to lie low, keep anonymous and protect him from forces that wants what he knows.
He was left with one specific memory. The legend of his ancestor, the reason why he, his uncle and some of their relatives are tieflings. A legendary pirate captain who made a deal with Asmodeus to rule the seas. According to some, that captain still sails the high seas with his undead crew, searching for a way to break the curse and to find a semblance of peace after centuries of violence and cruelty.
Now, Arxus seeks to find his ancestor, not just to break their curse, but to end the cycle of demonborn in their family.
And in the shadows, Asmodeus sees him as a potential pawn that he can tempt to take over the ship his ancestor sails and to wreak havoc onto the seas once again.
