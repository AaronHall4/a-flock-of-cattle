Daerrin grew up in the Drow high society of Menzoberranzan. He hailed from the 2nd House Barrison Del'Armgo, second only to House Baenre. He was son to none other than the Matron Mother Mez'Barris, and the house weapon master Uthegentel. Uthegentel was the largest drow in recorded history, and considered the best warrior in all of Menzoberranzan. Daerrin was considered a failure almsot immediately upon birth. He was small, fragile, and asked too many questions for his own good. Speaking out of turn or asking too many questions of your superiors was punishable by severe lashings and torture, of which he was quite familiar. He was noteably punished by his mother's own hands more times than he could count. Upon his coming of age, he entered The Academy under the school of Melee-Magthere. He quickly found out that he had a very easy time killing others, despite his families doubts about his fighting prowess. In combat, time seemed to slow to a standstill, and his opponents weakest vulnerabilities stood out to him like a sore thumb. He accidentally killed numerous other students during practice, realizing quickly that even a weak strike to an opponents vital organs could be lethal. It was here he was approached by the leader of the Dragon's Hord: Nisstyre. He was offered a job as a salaried Assassin, and quickly accepted the offer. He was brought to skullport, where he worked as a hired killer for many years, honing his craft to a cruel perfection.
