raised by wolves that was found by her family eventually just in time for an orc army to invade the forest by her home which was also where the wolves were. She helped lead the effort to clear the forest out! All exciting but there was an entire dwarf army involved and she really only did any kind of leading because she knew the forest really fucking well and most of her involvement was really a lot of scouting and spying and tactical planning. But she totally led it yes..
