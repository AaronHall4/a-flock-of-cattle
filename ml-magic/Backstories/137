He is from an influential clan in the home brew world that the campaign is set in. When he was young the clans mines and strong hold were collapsed in an earth quake and he was the only surviving family member. He was raised by a friend of his fathers who was a cleric of tempus. He grew up and in an attempt to clear rubble and reopen the way into his family's strong hold he used smoke powder (aka gunpowder) to make the worlds first explosive, and without out testing it or even knowing the full potential of the amount of powder he packed tried to clear the pathway back into his family's strong hold and mines. The blast was much larger and more powerful than he expected and the tunnel collapsed and pinned him crushing his left leg. He had to eventually amputate it to get out after no one came looking for him after a few days. After this he vowed to use his martial prowess and powers as a cleric to work as a mercenary and fund the excavation of his ancestral home.
