Bob is a human who's always been fascinated with magic. In his youth, he had always heard about the powerful magic of elves, and sought out an Elven master to teach him the ways of the Arcane.
It's been almost two decades now, and a middle-aged Bob is still learning the basics. He can not, for the life of him, figure out why his master won't advance him, and so he leaves his master in frustration, deciding that he could learn more out in the world than with his master.
Little did Bob know, his Elven master was rather ignorant of the shorter life spans of Humans. The Elf just assumed that Humans lived hundreds of years, so he figured Bob could spend a couple decades perfecting the basics.
