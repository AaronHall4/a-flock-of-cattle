Mordai comes from a region to the north of Klortho. He and his family wandered from town to town trying to find work, which was generally hard to find given their physical appearance. Early in life when he was around four, Mordai fell into a fast flowing river and almost drown if not for a stray tree branch. Later in life he found himself in the city of Klortho looking for work while trying to make an honest living. The only work he could find was at a barrel making company owned by a man named Henri who took pity on the disenfranchised races of Izal. There he formed a friendship with one of the foremen but was generally disliked and shunned upon even among the workforce. A few years later still working at the barrel makers he got into a very serious fight with a group of Halfings which nearly cost him his life however it was during this fight he discovered his innate magical powers. After killing several people in the fight including his foreman friend and Henri after his powers became wildly out of control he fled the city evading the law as best he could. After fleeing from the city he later learned that the surviving Halflings had blamed him for all of the deaths and the destruction of the barrel factory that they obviously razed to the ground. From that moment onward he swore to kill those Halflings and kill any who wrong him. Journeying to the other side of the world where Klortho law could not catch up with him Mordai travels to Kalan picking up an affinity for the crossbow along the way.
