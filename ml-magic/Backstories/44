At an early age, Arron's father was murdered by a local noble. Arron then devoted himself to getting revenge for his father's death. He spent is life trying to become the best sword fighter in the world, and when he finally though himself good enough, went to find the local lord. He found the lord's castle but arrived on the very day of his funeral. The lord had died the day prior. Arron fell into extreme grief that he could not get revenge himself. Finally, he resolved to continue his training as a swordsman and to wander around in search of a necromancer who could resurrect the noble so that Arron could duel him and kill him again. He also tries to find a ton of diamonds so that the necromancer can actually carry out the spell.
