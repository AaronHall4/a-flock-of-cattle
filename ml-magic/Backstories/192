grew up poor in the streets. Over time he noticed that all of the rich people talked in funny accents and dressed in suits and acted like perfect gentlemen and traveled a lot. Being not the crunchiest taco at the fiesta, he concluded that this must be how one becomes rich. He spent what money he had on a nice suit and behaves like a British aristocrat who knows nothing about aristocracy. He tries to be a gentleman, but he has a temper and if you damage his suit he will fly into a berserker rage and try and kill you with a croquet bat. His goal is to become rich.
