Unlike a lot of necromancers, he is kind, gentle, shy and has a good heart.   He got into necromancy because a part of him felt something was rather unfair and cursed about being a half-elf-that the lifespan of a half-elf is far less than a full elf, meaning that his elven mother would have to watch him grow old and die, right after watching her human lover.  His parents were once adventurers who settled down and married despite the long-term consequences of someone who will die in a few decades and someone who will die in a few centuries.  Thus after some time his parents split up to avoid the pain more.  His parents sent him away to boarding school to further distance themselves.  It would be in this boarding school where he would get his introduction to wizardry.

The rift in his family due to lifespan differences inspired him to research the fragile bonds and arcane knowledge of life and death, but then it also led him to other places and ideas-he started to show compassion toward undead and feel wonder about the condition of undeath.  He then started to take his ideas further and even think about mortality as a travesty to life.  This put him at odds with a lot of faiths, especially after he peppered clerics with philosophical questions about the role and purpose of mortal life.  Then he would start to embark on a quest to research immortality, preferably true immortality rather than undeath, but if this proves to put him at odds with the gods too much, he may have to settle for some form of undeath.  When he explains his beliefs to others, he comes across often as being simultaneously insane and compassionate.  

His journeys would take him to unexpected places and give him more to think about and perhaps test his ideals.  He doesn't like to kill, even to eat, but unfortunately he finds himself with traveling companions that could care less.
