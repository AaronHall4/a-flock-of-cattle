Second cousin to Diurmand, she is one born of with innate power. For 3 generations, the women of her family were blessed - or cursed - with the power of dragons when her grandmother helped save a silver dragon hatchling. However the master of the family, at odds with the silver dragon mother, outcast that side of the family, including his own wife. Meleena, with curious dark brown skin colour, silver hair, and a noticeable sheen of dragonscale, stands proud if not exactly tall. Her eyes burn an arcane blue at will, and yet the whole figure is somewhat ruined by a lisp. She ended up finding her way into a group of street urchins, using her powers to the group's aid.
