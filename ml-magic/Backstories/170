Tom’s Personal motto is
“Nothing that can be done tomorrow, needs to be done today.”
Previously under the employ of a regional Lord, Tom’s Duties were mostly that of a farm hand.
however, he was generally lazy. Preferring to plan his task rather than completin them. Because of that, he usually has the perfect way to complete his task with the minimal effort before they are due. Usually.
Between contemplating his task, and actually performing his task, Tom enjoys fooling around, doing whatever he fancies. To fund his funs, Tom does some admittedly questionable things, including but not limited to
Auctioning away his lord’s used possessions,
Auctioning away his lord’s wardrobe from last season,
Auctioning away his lord’s trash that Tom volunteered to dispose..
You get the idea.
But because of his work efficiencies, his lord gives him the benefit of the doubt.
However the final straw came when Tom tried to flip ambiguous fringe land that may or may not lie inside the domains of his lord.
Embittered, Tom swore to strike it rich, and buy out his lord’s lands and titles. If he will do so today, that is another question.
