he grew up as a blacksmiths apprentice in a small town, however at night he started getting harassed by some Drow who wanted him to make weapons for them for free or else they'll burn the shop down, so he packed some stuff up including a maul and chainmail he made and ran from the town. He doesn't know why they want weapons, came to him or can't make them themselves.
