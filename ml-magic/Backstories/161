Jonhas was a doctor in a small farming village. Not a big enough place to merit a full cleric, so a person trained in medicine was handy to have around. Jonhas ended up in this quaint little township after marrying a young tailor, Tia. She's a weaver and they have a ten-year old boy named Anton.
Life was pleasant for the family. That is until a rich nobleman came through town with his bodyguards.
No, nothing bad happened...
A few of the men had some injuries and the nobleman asked Jonhas to tend to them. Fairly simple business. The nobleman was quite impressed with Jonhas' skill, so much so that he asked Jonhas to accompany them. The noble offered Jonhas a hefty sum, far more than Jonhas would make in the village in some time, so Jonhas agreed. Handing the gold to his wife (She always had a better head for the finances), he left to travel with the Noble and his guard.
Along the road, the group were beset by vicious little lizard things (kobolds!). Jonhas did everything he could to mend the mens' wounds in the thick of things, but battle is battle and soon Jonhas found himself face to face with a monster.
Figuring that blood is blood and insides are insides, Jonhas struck out with his scalpel towards a vital area. The blade sliced true, and the little lizard beast bled out at Jonhas' feet. The noble was even more impressed, and proceeded to decide that Jonhas would be with them at all times.
