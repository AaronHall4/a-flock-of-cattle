Anton was raised in the church of Talos. He has no memory of his parents. The priests say that he was left on the steps of the temple as a child. He was trained as an acolyte until the day he was struck by lightning.  Anton believed it to be a sign that he was chosen by Talos.  He then set off as a wandering cleric, spreading the teachings of the Stormlord.
