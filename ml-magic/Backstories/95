Th'udd Fukkbeard of the Fukkbeard clan was just a wee lil dwarf of 10 years old when his entire family was slaughtered trying to punch a fire giant to death. Or so it seemed... Earlier that year, Th'udd's father Greatbush Fukkbeard had decided to make Th'udd the heir to the Fukkbeard clan, despite being adopted after appearing on the mountain's trail one day. This GREATLY angered the original heir, Greatbush II, as Th'udd was "just some mange ridden mongrel we found in the woods." Greatbush II began plotting revenge against his father, and most importantly Th'udd. He led the clan (sans Th'udd) to the fire giant's lair and shiftily escaped before the altercation began. To this day Th'udd knows not what happened to his brother, but he has vowed to become the strongest in the world in order to finish what his clan started by punching a fire giant to death.
