The 3rd child of a brewer and innkeeper, Brambles learned to love good food and drink, and even better stories at a young age! He thinks they should all be spread around for all to enjoy! When he came of age, he taught history to the children at his town's school. It didn't matter to him that the children were humans, hill dwarves, halflings, or elves. He just wanted to spread the light of knowledge and stories.
He joined the militia when the kobold and mercenary army of a dickish blue dragon threatened the prosperity and happiness of his county. He watched with the rest of his phalanx as the heroic Emerald Four defeated the blue beast! He decided to travel as the private tutor for a rich halfling family that was caught in his town by the battles, but now it is time to go home.
