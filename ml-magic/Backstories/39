Petrichor, previously known by a different name, grew up in a large city under a powerful and wealthy family. He trained to be a wizard in his young years, excelling in potential even beyond his tutors, though this potential squandered through his fascination with a unknown entity that haunted his dreams.

This mysterious force became an obsession to him; it spoke whispers that had no face, it showed him horrific images that held no meaning.

In fascinated fear he ran from his city, his family and even his name; he became poor and unknown. In time, Petrichor was born from the ashes of his past, the dreams still as vivid as his youth yet their mysteries still withheld from him.

If there was one thing his lifetime of exiled searching brought him, it was the knowledge that the deeper he delved in to his alien nightmares the more powerful he became.
