Criminal with his buddies once broke into a small library run by some old men. "They are just some old farts, they probably won't even notice us!". Some traps and a few dead buddies later, he was approached by some monks and was offered a choice. There in a nameless monastery of a nameless order of shadow he got his new name Crowbar and a mission - to bring knowledge into the monastery.
