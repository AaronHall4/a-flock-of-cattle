Craig was once the greatest lawyer on the material plans. He defended genocidal kings and regicidal rebels alike. He was torn into a portal of the abyssal realm by a demon who wanted him to defend him in the demonic equivalent of a parking ticket. Perhaps as a result of his patronage he ended up disbarred in the mortal realm and now is a lawyer for his Patron on retainer. He makes ends meet as an adventurer sending money to his wife and child.
