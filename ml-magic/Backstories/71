Once a rambunctious young man who asked too many questions and was too smart for his own good, Jimetheous Bobbington set off on his own on a journey of meditation and self-enlightenment. He always was smarter than those around him, and had a knack for figuring things out he was never supposed to know. It was this burden of knowledge that pushed him out of society and onto his own, to live as a reclusive hermit in the wilds. This left him free to pursuit his lust for knowledge unchecked, for so he thought. One night, as he slept soundly on the rock he used as a bed, a group of mysterious figures descended upon the campsite. They knocked him out cold, and dragged him away. When he awoke, he was tied to a bed, surround by mysterious magical devices in every direction he could see. They began teaching him things, filling his mind with knowledge. An endless stream of images, audio, and voiceless words filled his brain, consuming him completely. He laid here for what seemed like a lifetime, and for many, it was. For close to 70 years he was kept alive and used as a conduit of knowledge. Not only was he given knowledge, he was used as a repository as well, and felt the presence of others probing his mind for the answer to untold questions. Suddenly, everything went dark. A huge explosion rocked the building, and he was suddenly aware of his surroundings in a way he hadnâ€™t been in almost 70 years. His prison like bed had been overturned and he lay helpless on the floor, his atrophied muscles near useless. Armed men suddenly stormed the room, carefully tending to his wounds and escorting him from the building. They reintroduced him to society, told him of the terrible experiments run on his mind, and nursed him back to health.
