Once upon a time there was a lonely half-elf who wasn't sure the gods existed. Then something terrible happened to her and she prayed to any god that was listening for help. Someone answered her, but she has no idea whom. When she's in trouble she still prays and hopes whoever it was is still there. Normally, she/he/it is. Our accidental cleric really hopes it's one of the nicer gods.
