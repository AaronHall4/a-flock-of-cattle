When he was still an egg, a group of pirates (or sailors with an eye for treasure) raided an old dragonborn settlement/dragon lair, looting a massive quantity of gold in the process. They also happened to grab King's egg, thinking it was treasure, and threw it all into the cargo hold. Eventually someone went down to check on the treasure, and they found a newly hatched dragonborn with a crown sitting lopsided on his head. As a joke, the crew called the dragonborn King, and raised him like a son.
Years later, when King was an adult, a turtle dragon attacked his ship, killed the crew, and crashed the remains into a beach. King survived, and has begun hunting the beast around the continent it calls its own, vowing to avenge his fallen crew... And family.
