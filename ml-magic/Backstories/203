Diurmand is a capable boxer, who spent much of his formative years sparring with anyone who hadn't yet resigned to nurse their bruises. He's a tall and strong, though not especially built, human male with tan skin and a sly disposition. Proud of his noble heritage, Diurmand is unfortunately in line for pretty much only a pewter kettle, owing to the large family he hails from. Still, there's a grand old world out there, and be damned if there isn't more power to find for his family.
