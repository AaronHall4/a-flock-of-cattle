Relations between the Republic and the Ivenull Diarchy are very tense, therefore villages like the one Moriana grew up in house quite a few militiamen. One such a militiaman was her father, he always believed an invasion was imminent and prepared himself and his daughter accordingly. He dreamed of defending his family and his country, but the attack never came. Then one day he fell down a flight of stairs and died without ever having seen battle. Now Moriana travels across the continent in search of a battlefield to scatter her father's ash on, so that he can rest easy in the afterlife. But it's sadly not so simple, because Moriana has trouble finding a battlefield she deems worthy of her father.
