Born to the noble Hammerhand clan in the Dwarven province of Erendall, Ruby was bored to tears by her comfortable lifestyle and noble obligations. She longed for danger and adventure. She spent as much time as she could hunting in the mountains of Erendall where she developed considerable skill with a bow. Her father allowed it, as it is tradition for Dwarf women to do the hunting while the men work the mines and go to war. Still, all through her childhood, Ruby became accustomed to disappointing her father: Magnus Hammerhand, an esteemed Commander in the Dwarven Army. You see, Magnus believes in tradition above all else, and though he means well, his selfish greed has caused him to overlook the needs and desires of his only daughter in favor of the Hammerhand legacy. And on Ruby's 19th birthday, he broke the final straw. Ruby was to wed Sir Roderick Ruim: a wealthy human noble. To This arrangement, Ruby could not acquiesce. She fled to the wilds, getting by on her own strength for the first time and fell in love with her new found freedom. She knew she could not go back. Her heart grew bolder and braver. She began to desire ever more dangerous adventures which have led her to the great human city of Himlinde. To the Liar's Den Tavern, more specifically. And this is where our story begins.
