Tokugawa grew up in a small village on an island far away. Although he was but a simple fisherman, he trained every night in the art of the Ogachi in hopes of one day becoming a samurai. One night, while training, he was spotted by a group of travelling samurai. He was challenged to a duel, and gladly accepted. He quickly realized he was outmatched, and graciously accepted defeat. The samurai however, knowing he had won and was in control, told Tokugawa to surrender his wife for a night of pleasure. When Tokugawa refused and attempted to stop the man, he was cut down, slashed across the face, and left for dead. When he awoke, he found his house ablaze and his family murdered in cold blood. He was chased away by the samurai, and forced back onto his boat with nothing more than his Ogachi, fishing pole and backpack. He set sail never to return to this corrupt land, hoping one day to become powerful enough to avenge the death of his loved ones.
