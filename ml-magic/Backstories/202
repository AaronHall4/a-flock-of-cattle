Grigori doesn't remember anything that happened to him before two weeks ago. His first memory is of walking down the small road to <name of starting town>.
The kicker here is that Grigori is one of the first wizards. Ever. After achieving immortality and learning all the secrets a wizard can learn, Grigori stored all his accumulated knowledge in his interdimensional library. He then used a spell of his own design to relinquish all of his power, and memories, so that he could learn and live again.
Basically, Grigori spends all his time maxing out spellcasting classes so he can accumulate the most complete source of magical knowledge in the multiverse.
