Lucy was the daughter of the town's librarian, and she was a happy, excitable girl who loved to read. She read story after story about the heroes of myth and legend, and she wondered at the various characters and heroes. She didn't care about the noble knights and great warriors, to her the true heroes were the magicians, the wizards, the witches. They could do far more than fight, they could help people all around. She dreamed of being just like those wizards, just like those heroes. However, it was just that, a dream. There were no wizards in her town, none to teach her anyway, and her parents didn't have nearly enough money to send her to a magical academy. She resolved herself and worked hard in her Library, but hope was running out. Then, she got her big break.
