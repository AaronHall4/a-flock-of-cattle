Garbon, husband to Sienna Arralea, took her name upon marrying into the human circles, leaving behind his orcish tribe. Despite only being half-Orc, his heritage was strong and poignantly obvious in his mannerisms, morals, and strength. Due to a dispute over his favour of a human partner, he was forced into a combat with the chieftan - eventually fleeing for his life. Garbon swore an oath to see to it that others are not cast out and down for such petty reasons. He serves the Tannalen family as a guardsmen on their grounds, and had become strong friends with Diurmand Tannelen, becoming Diurmand's preferred sparring partner. The towering half-Orc, with moss green leathery skin and an unsightly number of scars, revealed his soft spot in adpoting (formally as well as actually) Kierlienne not long after catching her trying to lift some food from the Tannalen residence. His ability to find her, and his consideration of her as an actual person - not a pest - gave Kierlienne the push she needed to accept. Another young person now under the protective wing of Garbon.
Naturally, when Dirumand sought to take on some adventure, Garbon promised to protect him wherever. There was no chance Kierlienne would let him go alone on such adventure, and demanded she be allowed to join. After her uncomfortable admission to Diurmand as to how she met Garbon, Diurmand welcomed her into his new-found party with good humor. He was less welcoming to Meleena, suggested by Kierlienne as an additional contact. However, Garbon persuaded the nobleman to take in the outcast daughter.
