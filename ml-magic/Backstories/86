Since they met, Aaxaros never was a distant figure to Glaive. He, a young adult at those days, had a strong, yet unfound affinity for magic. This affinity brought him instinctively to a strange meeting deep in the local woods: A cult and a ritual, an attempt to give flesh to the Winter Duke. The young man's arrival broke the focus of the cultists, and the spell partially botched: Aaxaros' essence, now unrestrained, darted towards Glaive, the nearest creature with the greatest arcane potential in order to possess him, but due the ritual's initial purpose of creating a body, the demon fused with the young man's arm.
A few minutes of eldritch blasting mayhem later, as the pain was gone from both their minds, the demon and the man found themselves alone in the woods, trapped on eachother. Young Naras wouldn't be able to return to a normal life now being a demonic host, while Aaxaros wanted out from a body they were too weak to control or leave by itself, so they both stayed there for a while, they fixed a nearby abandoned cottage and lived there for some years, the demon teaching the man how to control the demonic power and the man looking for ways for them both to survive while as well for ways to them both get rid of each other.
Walgrave is a nice guy, usually quiet and reserved, but the years alone having a evil outsider inside his arm that talks to you via telepathy has brought up some quirks. He grew a affinity for dark humor that borders bad taste, he's bossy since he grew used to not having anyone to give him orders, he's prone to thinking out loud and often talks to Aaxaros openly and attempts to talk to people and to them at the same time. He is QUITE twitchy about people touching his left arm, that is where the demon resides (the arm is heavily mutated) and often gets paranoid on covering it up, and is suspicious of mostly everyone since the demon loves lies and half truths, but shifts into a sweetheart once he knows he's in a safe place with people that understands his situation.
