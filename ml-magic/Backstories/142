Formerly an executioner for a distant kingdom. He fucking loved his job so much that eventually he started to get carried away, torturing his victims well beyond the punishments decided by the courts. After a particularly gruesome execution where the accused suffered for days afterward, he was dismissed of his position and banished from the kingdom.
