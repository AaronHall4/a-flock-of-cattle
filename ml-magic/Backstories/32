Kermit Leroy Grenouille was born to a poor swamp family. He spent most of his childhood and adolescence alone out on the bayou, keeping a watchful eye over the family's only real possessions, their herd of giant, semi-domesticated frogs.
Bereft of most other company or education, he learned to use a long spear to defend the herd from predators with quick, flickering strikes, much like the frog's tongue, and to hop unpredictably from place to place just as his charges did. He is excellent at jumping and swimming.
Unfortunately, as the nearby cities expanded the swamps were drained to build shopping malls and tract housing. For the moment he lives in a trailer with his mother and his only surviving half brother. He drinks too much and intersperses mercenary work with stints as a bouncer at the local tavern to get by. He has a near indecipherable cajun accent and a large frog tattooed on his left bicep.
He'll take basically any excuse to get back out into the wilderness, regardless of the job - he's pretty poor at estimating risk, without much concept of serious danger to himself, and doesn't have much of a moral compass. Likes explosions.
