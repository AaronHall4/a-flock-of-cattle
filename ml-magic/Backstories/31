In his past he was a member of the military, a first lieutenant with command of his own platoon. In a very bad, no good deal with Pazuzu, the demon prince was promised his soul as well as those of his men. The platoon was wiped out but the character remains and now Pazuzu is after what he is owed. Roy scalps anyone he kills, as a symbolic offering to their lives to Pazuzu, but that won't get him out of the deal.
