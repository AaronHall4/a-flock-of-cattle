Rayen was born of noble blood, and lived a lavish life of study, hidden away in a castle most of her life pouring over books and completely oblivious to the hardships of the average man. Her father, a powerful elven Wizard, was once the right hand man of a powerful King. The king was killed in battle, and his wife, Rayens mother, was devastated. Due to their already close relationship, after the kings death, her father, Aelyeowyn, naturally began to console her and help take care of the kingdom. One thing led to another and they eventually grew very close, having a relationship in secret. When the Queen, Milandra, became pregnant with Rayen, they were forced to bring their relationship public. The kingdom was pleased, and everything was happily ever after... Or so they thought. Many years later, when Rayen was 19 years of age, tragedy struck. A Great Fiend, Charvekkanathor, that the king had made a pact with many years ago returned for the payment he was promised, and was not pleased to find him dead and a elf had taken the throne given to them by the fiend himself. In a fit of rage, he destroyed the castle in a great mountain of fire, and found Rayen hidden away, awaiting certain death. Wanting another servant on this plane of existence, he took her away from the castle, saving her life. Wisked away to one of the planes of hell, Rayen was forced to make a pact with the fiend, with the threat of death. He wants nothing more from her than knowledge of her world, and the occasional corruption and destruction of other living creatures, but may return one day to call upon his owed favor for saving her life. She unwillingly accepted, having no other choice, and found that she was bestowed great power by the fiend, far beyond what was traditionally available to a wizard of her land. After returning to her kingdom, she was accused of murder, having been seen with the fiend, and was forced to run for her life.
