Tristan grew up on the street, fighting out of rage, stealing to get by. When he was 13 he was forced to flee his home town after accidentally killing a bully during a confrontation.
During his travels he served as a bouncer, enforcer and petty criminal. Slowly, however, he came to see that the way he was living his life was self-destructive and malicious. He wanted to devote himself to a worthy cause and use his skills for the greater good.
He travelled to the Elven Free State and sought out his great uncle, a powerful mage and Lord in the Elven army named Saradrus. Saradrus immediately saw the boys potential, but saw also how he was teetering on the edge of corruption. He agreed to teach Tristan enough to begin his studies, but refused to teach him more and said " Only through dedication, effort and self-study can you master the Art. I will teach you how to see the path. You alone can walk it." Tristan, though disappointed, agreed.
He never blossomed into a Wizard as he'd once hoped, but instead found his strengths lay in blending steel and sorcery. Saradrus hired a blademaster named Ivelius Galanodel to train the young man in soldiery. Ten years later, Tristan left Saradrus' citadel to seek his own fortunes in the wider world.
