Garrett was a wizard's apprentice studying under a very powerful wizard. About one month into his apprenticeship, his master Tiren made a bargain with the devil. Tiren sold a soul for massive power. Not his own, of course, but young Garrett's soul. This is how a NG wizard came to be considered a worshiper of a LE deity for mechanical reasons.
