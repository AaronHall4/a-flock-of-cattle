My mother had left the village on a journey. The journey was only temporary, and she would soon return. However, while in a great human city, she was attacked and raped. Soon after, she discovered she was pregnant, and returned early
Her child was born, not to the resentment or despair, but with pity. They felt bad for me, as I had no choice to be a 'lesser breed', nor did my mother choose me to be. The others always encourage their children to play nice, and invite me to join them, which they did. But I was always more tolerated or accepted than wanted
In an attempt to become one of them, I turned to magic, practicing and perfecting small prestidigitation and tricks to amuse, so I could feel valuable and wanted. I grew up that way, always trying to be the class clown and fit in. Interestingly, my development closely mirrored that of normals. I reached adulthood only a few years before my friends.
I thought I would be happy there. But, soon after we were considered adults, my best friend and childhood crush got engaged. Soon after their wedding, I decided there was nothing left for me in the village, and left for human lands. My bringing up stuck with me: Always trying to be nice, and helpful, and funny. Always doing whatever I can to be valuable and wanted.
