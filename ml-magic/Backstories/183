orphan who got lost in the woods. He was eventually "rescued" by rangers, who initially captured him because they thought he was a threat. Fortunately, the child's cheerful disposition rubbed off on them and let him go. Also helping his case was the fact that he's a city kid who lives in an actual orphanage, which the rangers knew about. Grateful to his heroes, the half-orc aspired to be one of them and only recently joined their ranks.
