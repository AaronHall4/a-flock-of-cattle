a deeply religious born in a pleasant shire that was destroyed in the crossfire of a pointless war who was conâ€™d into a contact with a ruthless gang in the industrial city of Waterdeep at the age of 11 who would now rather kill you than make eye contact and is kinda in way too deep with the wrong sort of people.
