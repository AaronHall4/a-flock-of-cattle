he was just a physically weak commoner whose only redeeming qualities were his silver tongue, quick wit, and even quicker hands. He managed to befriend the Prince of a nearby town and got to spend a lot of time in the castle as a result. When the town was overrun and everybody in it slaughtered, he happened to be out of the town running an errand for the Prince. He took the opportunity to draft up fake letters that acknowledged him as the legitimized bastard of the Prince's Uncle - distant enough to be believable, and the closest remaining "relative" who should inherit the throne. Now he's attempting to gather up an army, re-conquer the city, and take back his "rightful" place as a King.
