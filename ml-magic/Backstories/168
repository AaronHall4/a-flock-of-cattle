Being born into a majority human society, Draax's orc-ish nature had him quickly outgrew all his peers. His intimidating presence caused all the school children to befriend him out of fear. These friendships were extremely artificial and when everyone graduated school, all his "friends" began to avoid him. Draax couldn't even get a job because of how terrifying he was. That is until Winchester Spoons, the halfling director at the local theater hired Draax to be the villain in his upcoming production. Winchester feared no one and decided why not give this brute, who had a perfect body for a terrifying villain, a shot at becoming the star of the show. It took sometime to teach Draax how to perform bardic magic, but once he learned the show became a success. Winchester was promoted to work in the king's court, and Draax was flooded letters of admiration. One letter read "To my son: Well Done!" Draax had never met his father but decided that this was evidence that his father was out there watching. Leaving the theater Draax decided to pursue bigger conquests as to further impress his father and hopefully...one day...meet him
