Richard grew up as a peasant on the country side, constantly fighting and getting into trouble. When he turned 16, he was drafted into the military, and gladly left his life of squalor behind for one filled with violence and battle. He served in the army for over two decades, rising in rank slowly as he proved himself to his fellow soldiers and commanders on the battlefield. He retired to a quiet house on the country side, with his wife and child, to live out the rest of his days peacefull and content. Several years later, he left his home for a few days to bring in supplies for the winter, and upon his return found them both deathly ill. They had a disease that seemed incurable, and the local healers had no luck restoring their health. Some time later, they both passed, leaving him heartbroken and alone. He had nothing else to live for, and vowed to do everything in his power to keep others from living out the same fate he had to endure. He traveled far from home, gave up everything to enter the clergy, and began his worship of Torm. He studied there for several more years before finally ready to began spreading Torm's word and helping those in need.
