As a child he was captured and given to a very rich merchant family as a ward, he spent a lot of time with the family priest, the only person who would give him much attention.
Eventually he became the family's protector. They no longer had to hire bodyguards as they had this live in half-orc who knew how to swing a warhammer and cast spells.
One day he was traveling alone with the family's eldest son, Josen. Josen wasn't very smart or strong but he was next in line to take over the business and Valt still loved him like a nephew.
They were attacked by goblins on the road, Valt shouted "stay behind me!" as Josen ran off and was struck by an arrow and was killed.
Valt blamed himself, the family blamed him, they disgraced his name and made sure he never found work in town again.
Until he was in a tavern and bumped into three adventurers who were looking for some muscle and some healing for a job.
