Cathal Silverwood grew up in the small town of Drinkleaf. He is the son of a Cobbler.
His parents, Aeden Silverwood(father) and Aiofe Silverwood(mother) raised him well, and although he got up to a few mischiefs as a youth, he developed into a valuable member of the community.
One of the key moments in his life was his acceptance as the apprentice to Cowan, the head ranger and woodsman of Drinkleaf. The ranger had chosen him after witnessing his defence of a young girl from a trio of bullies.
Several years of training in and around the nearby forest passed, Cowan teaching him how to track not only the beasts of the forest, but also the more elusive elves that resided there, and Cathal grew.
One day, as Cowan was considering promoting Cathal to full ranger, he got word that the lad had come under attack defending a young woman near the forest, Cowan and several towns folk rushed to his aid, only to find him helping the young lady up, flanked by two dead Gnolls. Cowan had made his decision.
The townsfolk were jubilant in celebration of Cathal's heroics and promotion, His father's business boomed as people came to his shop so they could talk about their town hero.
A few months passed, Cowan took on a new apprentice and Cathal had taken a post as a full fledged ranger. Cowan took him to the side one day and told him he was wasting his talents in such a small town, that he needed to go out and see the world, get a taste for adventure, develop as a person and as a ranger. Cathal enthusiastically agreed, and a week later he had gathered what possessions he saw fit, said his goodbyes and left the only home he had ever known.
