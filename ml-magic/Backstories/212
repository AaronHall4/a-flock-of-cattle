just found out that he isn't human. he already had a pretty satisfactory life as entrepeneur, smuggler, baker. he even managed to retire long enough to forget most of these skills, because as an not yet adult elf, it takes longer for him to get the knowledge into long-term memory.
he's on an adventure because there's not much to do at home anymore.
