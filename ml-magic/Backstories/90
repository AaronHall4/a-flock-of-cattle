Theodore Lionharte was a simple villager helping to setup decorations for the upcoming summer solstice festivities. He toiled for hours in the scorching heat, working through the water breaks he should have taken with the others. Sadly, as you might expect, he succumbed to a heat stroke and fell from the scaffolding. Hitting his head hard on the paved road beneath him, Theodore went limp.
He did not die, however.
It was miraculous that he survived at all, let alone without serious injury. It was a miracle, yes. One that he attributed to the first thing his delirious eyes looked upon as he awoke: the sun. Theodore now understands that the gods are false. The one true heavenly father has been there his entire life, bathing him in its glorious incandescence, protecting him from injury.
Now, Theodore Lionharte, a name that our Radiant Father has bestowed upon him, dedicates his life to spreading the word of the one true god.
