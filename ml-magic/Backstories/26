he'd fallen so far in grief over the death of his human teacher and best friend that he secreted away an artifact that promised it would be able to bring the dead friend back. Elden followed the shadowy, black crystal's instructions, but the instructions were so layered with redundancies and dead ends that the artifact won the battle of minds, completing its purpose. As a 'gift', Shar, the creator of the artifact, put a shadow in Elden's mind so that he would not remember what he did. Shar, being the BBEG, didn't take kindly when Elden joined a party who specifically wanted to kill Shar, and slowly eroded the shadow so that he would be driven to insanity and grief when he realized that he singlehandedly killed every person he ever knew.
