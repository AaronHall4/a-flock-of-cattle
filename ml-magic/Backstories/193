Born in a small village in the Crags, her whole family was slaughtered by orcs when she was only 3, and compelled by her mother to "Run away, Kara!" she ran off into Neverwinter Woods to survive. There, she was found by a family of giant, talking wolves, who raised her in the ways of the woods, as a ranger. Now 18, she has sworn to defend the innocent from the same fate that befell her, and slaughter every orc she meets in the process.
