Edicius is crazy. He truly is. Fully aware of how humans treat his kind, the Teifling spent many years studying his infernal heritage. Unlike some who strive to be accepted, Edicius knew he would never be trusted by humans. His big horns and long tail gave away his demonic origins at first look. So he studied, and learned, and eventually made contact with Lilith, one of the Devils of the Rings of Hell. His pact with her cost him his sanity, but gave him magic beyond belief. Now he worships here, taking down powerful creatures as sacrifices, with nothing but his pet Imp and his "friends" by his side
