He's a criminal enforcer in a local gang who also wrestles, though he often is the fall guy who gets defeated by humans and even once, a halfling. His antics includes throwing rocks at his opponents and smashing stones on his head.
On a job where he had to collect protection money, he roughed up an antique seller who fled,leaving behind a dusty demonic icon. He rubbed off the dust and this awoke the being inside the medallion, which promised him powers. Az'zak, down on his luck, shrugged and agreed.
Az'zak didn't feel very different. He thought it was just another trick. However, the icon did grant him powers, but it just isn't apparent to Az'zak. When he uses his eldritch blast, what is visible aren't rays but pieces of rock that he pulls out from a big pouch on his belt - he calls it his pouch of endless rocks. His hex is his usual cursing and taunting of opponents; his true strike is his pointing and telling his foes "YOU GOING DOWN!" The icon regrets granting Az'zak his power but a deal's a deal...
