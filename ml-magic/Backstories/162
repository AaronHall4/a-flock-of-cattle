Born the 4th of 5 children, and the 3rd son, Albrecht had no illusions about his place in the world. Born into a family that valued martial and physical might, Albrecht was born sickly and weak. His weakness made him an embarrassment to his family and his position as 3rd son meant he had no hopes of inheriting anything.
While his brothers grew and trained as warriors, and his sisters educated as noble ladies, Albrecht was left alone. Of course that didn't much matter to Albrecht, who found his own passion in reading. By his early teens Albrecht began to show a talent for magic, and he was sent away to a prestigious magical academy to be trained as an officer and weapon of war. While the military focus of his training bothered him a little, the access to the library and a new wealth of knowledge easily overshadowed it.
However, all good things must come to an end and Albrecht was recalled home... to marry. Now that he was no longer a family embarrassment, he was a useful pawn in the political machinations of his father. For the first time in his life Albrecht truly rebelled. Slipping away from the caravan sent to carry him home with his distinctive red leather coat billowing in the breeze, Albrecht set off to find his own path and all the knowledge he could find.
