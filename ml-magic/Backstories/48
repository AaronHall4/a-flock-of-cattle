Arden was a runt-of-the-litter, so to speak. He was left at a doorstep in Rogarsheim, with naught but a nametag with his Draconic name in the Common alphabet: "Arjhan". His mother left on a voyage to Neverwinter with Arden when he was but three months old, but the ship was beset by pirates off of the Korinn Archipelago. The pirates, aboard the Dragonfury, a fairly infamous pirate ship, then adopted Arden after his mother's death in the raid, taking a Dragonborn's presence as a good omen for the ship. Fifteen years later, Arden had become one of the Dragonfury's chief boarders, making up for what he lacked in strength with superior reflexes and acrobatic ability, but the ship was attacked by another pirate ship - the Stormrider. Though Arden tried to swim off during the raid, the pirates made him a galley-slave, intending to sell him off at landfall. When they reached port, though, Arden escaped, becoming a bodyguard, bouncer, hitman (one notable adventure being the assassination of the knight Jarred Oakhold), and eventually a naval hero-for-hire after mugging enough money to make the journey to Neverwinter, a distant memory from his childhood. When our story picks up, Arjhan has discovered a realm infinitely more treacherous than the perils of the sea... DRY LAND.

Arden has since went to Phandallan for a job for one Gundran Rockseeker. Gundran's disappeared, but the job is done and Arden considers himself free from commitment.
