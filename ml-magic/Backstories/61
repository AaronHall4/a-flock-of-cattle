Born to the elven house of Nailo, Wrenn was raised by his mother Kalla, high priestess of Boccob. Under her discipleship a young Wrenn gained his arcane knowledge. As he grew, Wrenn came to be considered a scholar in his own right and endeavored to increase his knowledge by adventuring. Wrenn is a lissome man with fair skin and blue eyes. His messy black hair frames a carefree, expressive face. Laidback, jovial, and eccentric in demeanor; Wrennâ€™s playfulness belies a cunning mind.
