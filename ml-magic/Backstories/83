Dad pacted her to a creature of the Underdark when she was very young, and her mom bred her to become a demonbinder without her knowledge. PC grew to resent Lolth, found out about the demonbinder thing, and fled to the surface. Scared a village, killed a child by accident, got badly injured, fled into the woods. PC finds a cabin and attempts to steal medicine. Turns out owner is there and he's an eladrin cleric of Corellon. They fight, she loses. He doesn't kill her because she's not a follower of Lolth. He heals her, they spend time together, through shenanigans they fall in love. They live together for 50 years until an accident occurs and he's nowhere to be found. PC searches for him for years, then presumes him dead because she figures it's easier to cope that way. Ends up filling odd jobs as a mercenary and meets the party to hunt a bounty. Campaign begins.
