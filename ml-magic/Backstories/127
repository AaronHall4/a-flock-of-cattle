She lived in a society where each small village had a warlock, who made a pact to protect the village. But for the past few generations bandit lords had taken over. The warlocks could no longer protect the villages and were simply looked down upon and ostracized. She knew that her fate was to sell her soul and make a pact, and that terrified her. The beings that these pacts were made with were not kind... she imagined her life as a warlock would be unfulfilling and lonely and her afterlife would be full of torture and other unpleasantries.
One day, her and her bestfriend stumbled upon a wizard lab in the woods, and in it was a journal very vaguely describing lichdom. When she saw that, she decided it was her way out. She could cheat death. And thus, she became a necromancer and started adventuring.
