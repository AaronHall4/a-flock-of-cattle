When he was a boy, he hated the idea of being tied to demon magic (he is very well read, as his mom is a teacher), so he tried to saw off his horns, which failed miserably. Once he realized he could not remove his heritage, he adopted the name Vigil and vowed to combat it by being Good.
He enlisted in the army as soon as he could, but was a very poor soldier (which is why he was still level 1 at age 52) because no one trusted him enough to train with him (if you saw a demon in camp, you probably wouldn't exactly warm to him), and he was assigned meaningless duties like mess and guard duty. After gritting his teeth and waiting to be recognized for over a decade, he grew frustrated with the army and left.
The next period of life saw him fall deep into darkness, no longer fighting against his evil heritage (more of a perceived disposition than an actual dark side, up to this point). He roamed the lands as a marauder and Highwayman, taking what he wanted and not caring for anyone's life, not even his own. After many years of this, he saw a bent old man traveling all alone. Sensing an easy target, he attacked.
He awoke propped up against a tree, the old man bent over him looking into his eyes. "Just kill me," he said. The old man told him he would not, as he knew there was a great power within him that could be used for good. Disbelieving, the tiefling again asked to be put out of his misery (as he was in no shape to fight or flee). The man ignored him and carried him to an abbey of mages, where he was treated and cared for.
Finally finding respect (from most of the mages, anyway), he became Vigil once more, dedicated to good, but now with renewed purpose and newfound power. He studied there for several years, learning a bit of magic and incorporating it into his daily routine.
After a time, he grew restless in the abbey, and set off in search of adventure in response to dark changes in the world.
