Despite working with a good party, he's still selfish and kind a dick, but understands from living in Drow society that it's impractical to be evil. Eventually after the self-destruction of his own city he survived to flee onto the surface to become a criminal mastermind. He travels collecting relics and hoarding them in a vault to prevent people who would abuse them to the detriment of the world. You know, the thing he lives on. I came up with a half-orc fighter with Amnesia, i've been wanting to play. He travels doing good for all he can with his mangy mut. Everyone hates him at first for some reason especially paladins. He has amnesia is because a couple years ago he was a BBEG anti-paladin. In the final fight with some heroes, he was cast off a cliff and "died". He survived barely with brain damage and amnesia. All he knows is he feels guilty of something and wants to change the world for the better. He hides his face behind his helmet to avoid being attacked by towns folks and his only friend is his dog.
