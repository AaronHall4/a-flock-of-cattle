on a ship at sea with her parents, when the ship was beset by a particularly nasty storm. While her parents died as a result of the ship foundering and going down from the violence of the storm, they were able to get Meriele to a raft made from part of the ship. She was rescued by the crew of the privateer ship Dragons Tooth.
The crew took to Meriele, and considered her a mascot, and raised her on the ship. As she got older, she started participating with the crew in running the ship and working during raids on other ships, earning over time a reputation in her own right.
After fleeing an encounter with an foreign military ship, the privateer ended up wrecked on the reef around the island that the warrior monk Order of the Mithral Hand was based on.
Meriele was (again) the only survivor of the wreck, and was severely wounded and nursed back to health by the warrior monks.
Exposure to the monks, and their philosophy, Meriele spent her healing time thinking about her past, and came to the realization that her destiny isn't to be a pirate or privateer, but to do good for other people as both the privateers and monks have done for her.
To this end, after taking vows with the monks and completing her initial training in the Order of the Mithral Hand, Meriele has left the island and is working to atone for her poor choices in early life and to help others.
