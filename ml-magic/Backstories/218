Not far from the city she was set upon by a group of bandits, but before they could rob her a dashing human rogue appeared and swept the bandits away. He guided the priestess home, and after two years of courtship they were married. Before the rogue proposed, he revealed to the priestess that he in fact had orchestrated their meeting, for the bandits were his friends. He had planned the entire charade in order to meet this beautiful elf. The priestess was to take a vow of chastity and become the head of her church, however once she married a human she was disowned from her family and ostracized from the church. 10 years later a half elf child was born, they named him Naephid. Naephid grew up worshiping in the church of Pelor surrounded by fellow half elves. His mother and father brought him up in the church, and his father told him stories of places where race didn't matter. Outside of the church, Naephid only had one friend, his next door neighbor Elle. When Naephid was 20 years old, his father died. Naephid, knowing that some day his mother will also have to watch him die, decides he must leave home to find a place in the world. Taking his father's scale mail, the mace and shield of Pelor, and his mother's blessing he began his journey. He arrived in the forest to find Elle, waiting for him (Elle was played by my friend and she had her own backstory as well where she decided to run away from her overbearing father). Together, Elle and Naephid set off into the world looking for a place where anyone, no matter who you are, can make their own happiness.
