Turns out that he is in fact, adopted. But it gets weirder. To do a very very quick summary of our plot, we spent a good portion of the campaign looking for the Ascendants, the most powerful mages of the past that we locked up to be used as superweapons. In one town, we're going through customs and my Bard introduces himself as a Halfling. The guards start yelling at him and he's almost in tears because no one believes that he's a Halfling. Finally, they get someone to do a magical blood test. The results? Halfling.
Our group went wild when that was revealed. Shortly after, we find the next Ascendant, a human mage that looks almost exactly like my character. It turns out that he married a Halfling woman and they conceived a child through magical means 1000 years ago, and when they other mages came to lock him up, he flung my Bard and his mother into the future to protect them.
