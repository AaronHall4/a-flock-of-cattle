Eldon's parents died at the hands of a Ghoul when Eldon was 16. Eldon has forcefully forgotten all the gory details of that fateful day, and just remember his parents as they were before. They were jewelers in town and were well respected but not well off by any means.
After that Eldon ran away into the Mountains where he was found by an old Human Ranger, Terin Wolfsbane, that taught him how to be a ranger. Years they spent together learning about the land and as Terin grew very elderly the tides turned and Eldon had to take care of him. It was then that Eldon took back to being a Jeweler and Tinker to allow him buy herbs and potions to help his ailing mentor. He also spent a good portion of time learning what he could about the undead. A deep hatred manifested of all things undead, as he slowly came to terms with his parent's deaths.
In Eldon's 35th year of life, Terin passed away, leaving Eldon with no sense of purpose. Eldon started selling more jewelry in town to cut through his depression but soon uncovered a scam the local Jeweler's Guild was running in the market involving the local ruby supply. It was then Eldon made up his mind to steal the next shipment of rubies the Guild had incoming into the town to give them out to the poor. It was a daring plan that somehow came together and the Guild never knew it was Eldon, but the people he helped do. During the theft, Eldon also came upon a 1 oz block of unknown material that he kept to remind him of the deed and he set off on his grand life adventure after that.
