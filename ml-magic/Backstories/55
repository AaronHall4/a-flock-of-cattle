My sister and I were living at an orphanage when she was adopted by some aristocrat. I've been trying to become somewhat of a famous thief in hopes she'll recognize me from posters. Unfortunately, I am extremely embarrassed about my appearance, so I never show my face in public. It's a conundrum. Maybe she'll recognize my......jawline? (My face is usually only hidden from above the mouth by a cloak)

This one time, I was dared to dress as a maiden for 24 hours and received many escort requests from people who thought I was a woman. So now, when I need to disguise in a situation where speech isn't necessary, I pull out my dress and wig.

I receive far more complements while I'm in disguise, so I've taken to appreciating my appearance more while dressed as a woman. I once stabbed an inn-keeper through the hand when he tried to touch me sexually. Needless to say, I am no longer welcome there.
