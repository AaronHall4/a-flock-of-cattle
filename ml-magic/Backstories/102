One night he lost his wife and newborn son in childbirth and something started to slowly unhinge in his mind. That night he tried to drink away his sorrow and ended up killing a man in a bar fight.
Fleeing to the mountains so as to avoid execution, Kharad dealt with the self-imposed guilt of his wife and son's death. He lived in the cold mountain range for many years, befriended a strong, ancient dire-ram he named Khuld (the name of his son).
One day, Kharad and Khuld were scavenging for herbs in the mountains foothills. He came upon the sounds of fighting. Upon inspection he found a weakened man battling a great Rune Bear (magical dire bears marked by magic radiation). Kharad and Khuld saved the man, but Khuld died in the process.
The man turned out to be a creature of the Feyweld, deceived and weakened by political enemies and left in this world to die. The Fey's name was Magnen and he was an official of the Unseelie court. He felt inclined to reward Kharad for saving him but, being Unseelie, did so in a twisted fashion.
He planted with Kharad a seed of magic. Powers that would one day be great and powerful, but did not alert Kharad of this. As far as Kharad was concerned, all the Fey did was break off the horn of his closest friend, Khuld, hollow it out, enchant it with some magic, and left.
Kharad was stricken with grief and rage. That night he buried Khuld. Holding his horn in his hands, Kharad became consumed by rage. The horn grew hot and flames erupted around Kharad, lighting the nearby trees aflame, but Kharad was unhurt.
It was then that Kharad realized what had happened. Kharad packed up his camp, and set out to avenge his friend, control his power, and combat the Unseelie court.
