Raf was a slave whose mother was killed pretty brutally by a foreman named Gaffon, who worked for the slaver Irikat near Tyr. Upon being sold to another slaver for work in the fighting pits, Raf's caravan was attacked by raiders. Raf killed Gaffon's son Jadik and fled into the desert, where he lived for many years as a nomad. He has since heard of Tyr's emancipation, and thinks that it might be a good time to come back to Tyr to find Gaffon and Irikat for some "fun." At the very least, it might be a good source of coin.
