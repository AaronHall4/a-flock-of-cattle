a fighter that has grown up a devout adherent to the local church in a fairly major city. He sees the clergy every day. He sees clerics heal plagues and paladins clear out dens of demons and necromancy. He trains his body and mind to be a vessel for his god, but he never hears that call. He is never granted the power of the god he so desperately believes in. No divine magic ever pours out of his hand, no visions are shown to him.
