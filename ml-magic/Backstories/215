He's the brother of a blacksmith the party has befriended, who asked them to allow Trauban to join them so he can gain more world experience. Trauban is specifically a Cleric worshipping Tharmekhul, the Dwarven god of the forge, and he intends to use the power he gains to help his brother's business. I plan on using this as a method for the party to gain access to masterwork (and later magical) weapons.
