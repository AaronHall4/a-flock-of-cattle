his entire village disappeared one day alongside most of his memories. He can still remember the abstract, he remembers Titania giving him his power, he remembers his humble gnome village, but he can't remember names or face and he's remembering less and less everyday. He's deadset on finding out what happened to his people and why he can't remember them before he forgets that he's even looking for them.
